AAPL,"It is great that you started investing so young, it is the time for high risk/reward since you have time to recover after. It is good to take note of your reactions and behavious when things don't work out as expected. You may have thought you would react a certain way but then realize that you did not react the way you thought you would.

It is good to balance your risk and be realistic. **Trying to make money fast usually results in paying for being impatient**. Since high risk comes with high reward it means you only need to invest a little bit, on the off chance that it works out to your benefit. So you can have a big chunk of money in an ETF / Index fund / ect and then a small sliver for doing your own higher risk trades.

You have many years before retiring and it helps to put it in perspective. $25k over a lifetime is not that much, but use this as a lesson for yourself to grow and become a better investor. I am sure it already has you thinking more about your decisions and wanting to be more strategic. **That is progress already!**

You could have made it big on ur AAPL and GME and then lost all that just as easily due to the same risky all-in behaviour. Learn and grown and be patient with yourself and investing.",glqp3il,1612308989,2/2/2021 16:36

AAPL,"It is great that you started investing so young, it is the time for high risk/reward since you have time to recover after. It is good to take note of your reactions and behavious when things don't work out as expected. You may have thought you would react a certain way but then realize that you did not react the way you thought you would.

It is good to balance your risk and be realistic. **Trying to make money fast usually results in paying for being impatient**. Since high risk comes with high reward it means you only need to invest a little bit, on the off chance that it works out to your benefit. So you can have a big chunk of money in an ETF / Index fund / ect and then a small sliver for doing your own higher risk trades.

You have many years before retiring and it helps to put it in perspective. $25k over a lifetime is not that much, but use this as a lesson for yourself to grow and become a better investor. I am sure it already has you thinking more about your decisions and wanting to be more strategic. **That is progress already!**

You could have made it big on ur AAPL and GME and then lost all that just as easily due to the same risky all-in behaviour. Learn and grown and be patient with yourself and investing.",glqp3il,1612308989,2/2/2021 16:36

If you plan on investing long-term, diversify your portfolio and get used to buying in at regular intervals, just like you'd deposit into your savings account. Volatility is part of the game but by investing regularly over time, you'll track the market up.

8 months ago was the start of an absolutely insane market rally, from the bottom of an absolutely insane market dip. Everyone who began investing there experienced ""easy mode"". Just pour money into stocks and ride the speculation wave up.

Going forward, consider diversifying, either into broader ETFs (your VWRA looks somewhat diverse, but it's also heavily tech-focused), or at least into blue-chip companies in other sectors outside of tech. Don't worry about the 'dips'. If you don't sell, you don't eat a loss. MSFT and AAPL will be fine.",gorfcia,1614320541,2/25/2021 23:22

Not financial advice. Especially with COVID recovery, money is going to move around a lot more as entertainment industry begins to open. Will probably see a slowdown of tech as money moves into other industries.

I would expect growth to go back to pre-pandemic levels this year as life returns to normal. Will see some breakout of technologies that got really good exposure during the pandemic.",goq4n2a,1614301922,2/25/2021 18:12

If you have a higher risk tolerance this can be fine. However, if this dip is making you squirm you need to reassess. It's well within normal fluctuations. 

I'm not saying blindly sell but you should consider what the best path forward is. I'm down about 15% in the last week; for the same reason. I'm over concentrated (and leveraged) in AAPL specifically. However, I'm content to ride it out and using covered calls to mitigate the losses. 

You said, you've only been involved in the market for 8 months, market performance over that timeline is not 'normal'. The gains have been way above normal due to three factors. One, we came off the COVID crash (an over reaction). Two, massive stimulus inflating equity prices (this will end eventually).

It‚Äôs not a loss until you sell.

With a bad stock that can be a mistake to hold , but I really do not believe that companies like AAPL and MSFT won‚Äôt recover.

Always keep some money on the sideline for corrections and for crashes- these are the best times to strike. I've made the most profound jumps in net worth during these periods.

AAPL,"Your portfolio might be 'solid stocks' but they're in a single sector which is currently teetering at the peak (or just past the peak) of a massive speculative bubble.

If you plan on investing long-term, diversify your portfolio and get used to buying in at regular intervals, just like you'd deposit into your savings account. Volatility is part of the game but by investing regularly over time, you'll track the market up.

8 months ago was the start of an absolutely insane market rally, from the bottom of an absolutely insane market dip. Everyone who began investing there experienced ""easy mode"". Just pour money into stocks and ride the speculation wave up.

Going forward, consider diversifying, either into broader ETFs (your VWRA looks somewhat diverse, but it's also heavily tech-focused), or at least into blue-chip companies in other sectors outside of tech. Don't worry about the 'dips'. If you don't sell, you don't eat a loss. MSFT and AAPL will be fine.",gorfcia,1614320541,2/25/2021 23:22

Not financial advice. Especially with COVID recovery, money is going to move around a lot more as entertainment industry begins to open. Will probably see a slowdown of tech as money moves into other industries.

I would expect growth to go back to pre-pandemic levels this year as life returns to normal. Will see some breakout of technologies that got really good exposure during the pandemic.",goq4n2a,1614301922,2/25/2021 18:12
AAPL,"You're way over concentrated. If your concerned about safety you need to diversify. Those ETFs double up on a few stocks and overlap with the stocks you chose. When buying ETFs you need to consider what they contain. 

If you have a higher risk tolerance this can be fine. However, if this dip is making you squirm you need to reassess. It's well within normal fluctuations. 

I'm not saying blindly sell but you should consider what the best path forward is. I'm down about 15% in the last week; for the same reason. I'm over concentrated (and leveraged) in AAPL specifically. However, I'm content to ride it out and using covered calls to mitigate the losses. 

You said, you've only been involved in the market for 8 months, market performance over that timeline is not 'normal'. The gains have been way above normal due to three factors. One, we came off the COVID crash (an over reaction). Two, massive stimulus inflating equity prices (this will end eventually). Three, insanely low interest rates (which are beginning to rise).",goqh7uj,1614306819,2/25/2021 19:33

AMC,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö",glbjia9,1612000347,1/30/2021 2:52

The volume was low which could be because of people moving away from robinhood and places like that, sites restricting purchases and also a lot of people who weren't diamond hands selling at the start and a lot of day traders. It's a new day though, we should see a bump at pre market again and Tuesdays are usually big days if we get some momentum going analysts are predicting we could close the day around 16 or 17. The problem was the volume and not enough diamond hands! People either getting afraid and selling off or just taking profits, we need to really hold! Tomorrow will be a better day. The hedges are trying to drive the price down as low as they can and start closing because they really don't want a repeat of GME so let's all buy more if we can and hold! We only get were we need to be by holding! The next 2 days are going to be pivotal for AMC! If we can break the 16 barrier and stay above it preferably finish above it its a great sign.

AMC," $AMC....  UPDATE: February 04th, 2021  


What is happening?  
Shorts are ladder attacking the share price back and forth. They've been doing this for a while as we all know. This is illegal for them to do, but the SEC has not done anything about it and likely won't. Is the system rigged? Yes, it is.  


What can we do:  
The share price you see is not technically what the share price should be. The ladder attacks are hedge funds trading shares back and forth between each other which drives the price down. Their goal is to drive the price down using their tactics and ability to do so. The majority of us are buying, not selling. This is good for us because those who bought high can now average down. Do not kid yourself, the Hedge Fund's will continue this for as long as they can to steer you away from buying more, and to convince you to sell. Once you do - they cover. They are not covering with the shares they are trading back and forth. Eventually, these HF's will have to cover and buy back your shares. Yes, this may take longer than you want or expect, but eventually, they WILL give in. When they start buying, they need to increase their bid if people refuse to sell. Eventually, they have to bid up to the lowest price someone will ""ask"" for. This is the significance of HOLDING. Buy, and hold. These cheap prices right now are gold for the retailer.  


The hedge funds are playing serious psychological games that they play to wear down the interests and hype of the stock. Again, do not kid yourself. These guys have billions and will pay good money to learn ways on how to manipulate you and your actions.  


When will the squeeze happen?  
Nobody knows. You cannot ""time the market"". This could happen shortly, or it could happen in a week or two, maybe a month. It all comes down to how long the hedge funds are willing to wait and continue paying interest on their positions. Remember, they need your shares. They can only buy them from you if you are willing to sell them. If everyone just buys and holds, they are stuck. This is the squeeze to force them into buying from you. RIGHT NOW - notice how the share price is flashing back and forth between $7.09 and $6.96 ?? Is that not suspicious ? back and forth? This just proves what they are doing to manipulate.  


Fundamentals:  
AMC is debt free and about to start opening up. That means they are going to start posting revenues in the near future. Why is this important? Because when you have a clean balance sheet of little to no debt and report making good revenue, this looks very very good for the financial world. If a company looks good financially, their stock price will almost always increase. AMC has growth ahead of them which makes this stock worth a lot more than what the ticker shows right now. If you do not need the money - for sure, let this ride for the long run - you WILL make money.  


Charts & More:  
Volkwagen did the same thing as what AMC is doing now. It almost went back to the previous low before it shot up. Do you think Hedge Fund's weren't in the same boat then as they are now? They will try to tank this as much as they can, until they cannot hold on anymore. Eventually, they will pay.  


A $2m dollar $20/call bet was placed the other day. This is an extremely good sign, provided this investor knows something. I don't know about you, but if I were going to wager a $2m bet that this stock was going to be $20 or above by end of February, I'd have done my homework. Based on this alone, I believe this says there is a greater chance that it will, than wont, be $20 or above come end of Feb.  


So, my fellow retail investing friends, the game here is patience. HF can play all the dirty tricks they want but eventually they will break. They cannot afford to be patient, we can. REMEMBER THIS.... AND... HOLD HOLD HOLD!!! PLEASE cut & paste and SHARE EVERYWHERE!!!!",gm2jnp7,1612521736,2/5/2021 3:42

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

AMC," KEEP REPOSTING THIS:  Why the stock prices are going down: Robinhood is currently one of the biggest platform of which people are using to buy volatile stocks (People just started to invest to make money, and Robinhood is the friendliest platform). Robinhood currently blocked the buying option on the volatile stocks, such as NAKD, AMC, GME, NOK. Since people can't buy but can only sell, it is obvious that the price will plummet down. However, when robinhood's trading restriction gets lifted, the prices of the stocks will get stonked, so PLEASE HOLD UR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER UNTIL THEY GO UP DONT SELL!",gl3se1w,1611877539,1/28/2021 16:45

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",glbjtm9,1612000501,1/30/2021 2:55

AMC,"üö®MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC: üö® It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us.

AMC,"**Read 
I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I‚Äôve been waking up at 5 am excited to see the market and I feel like I have a purpose again or at least the spark before the flame of one. That being said when GME hits 1000 I will be getting the rite aid bottle of whiskey from family guy to represent the lowest low I came out of because our you apes  tattooed https://imgur.com/gallery/yFUlBkW,gop19t2,1614281926,2/25/2021 12:38
AMC,"Don't be like me.  Hold.

I sold all my AMC and GME last week in order to free up my capital and ""invest"" in other stocks.

I devolved from ape form in order to be human and lose more money from these said stocks, when I could've just held on with my once diamond hands and added more funds to my account, instead of selling on a 60%/$1000 loss (not so much to the average person, but to a college student, quite a lot no?)

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.  But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.

Alas, It's too late for me, but it's not too late for the rest of yous.  DON'T SELL.  Hold.  Make this shoot out of the Milky Way.  Make the Hedgies pay.  Sing GME shanties if you need to force yourself off the sell button to stay on course.  And I wish each and everyone of you shooting up, and hopefully see you guys shoot past Pluto.

Wish you all üíéüôåüèº",gonu3ei,1614250349,2/25/2021 3:52

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES NEED TO BUY TOMORROW and FRIDAY‚Äî- Let me explain How their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",glwvsrr,1612417396,2/3/2021 22:43
AMC,"The whole reason hedge funds were shorting AMC was because they believed AMC would go bankrupt before the pandemic ended. And they almost succeeded. We helped AMC avoid bankruptcy and that is a blow to hedges who can't get a tax break on those shorts now (I think but really don't know because I'm a retard). We helped save a business we all love. And if a squeeze doesn't happen (and it might not), consider holding out until AMC fully recovers. If you can. Everybody has their own financial choices to make and it's okay if you can't hold out that long. #saveAMC is the real prize and the second best way to fuck hedge funds.",glwz3pe,1612418808,2/3/2021 23:06

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES NEED TO BUY TOMORROW
 Let me explain How their options contracts work. WITH ******INFO I FOUND HERE
The hedge-funders have a week, THIS WEEK to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 

 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till TOMORROW but some of these contracts haD to be bought by Wednesday. THATS WHY WE SAY POSITIVITY ON WEDNESDAY. They have til TOMORROW to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price . WHICH IS WHAT THEY‚ÄôVE BEEN DOING. Between Wednesday and tomorrow, they‚Äôre were doing everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZEDr‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",gm1t89y,1612509311,2/5/2021 0:15

AMC,"Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!!#

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Don't listen to anything I say. I'm not a financial advisor, I eat crayons and gather facts from a memes

AMC,"OK LISTEN UP

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.",gkr7cz9,1611640076,1/25/2021 22:47

When you buy at pre-market all it does is inflate the price and you‚Äôre shares aren‚Äôt bought yet until the market opens

Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

AMC,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect with $AMC this week:

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

AMC,"NASDAQ publishes a report on short positions twice af month. According to sources who has acces to this report, the hedgefond holding AMC shorts (15. january estimated 41%, others on reddit have said 62%, and maybe even more at this time), a unknown percentage of their short was set at 9$, which is why it was important to close above that last friday. This short is said to run out today - meaning they will have to pay 0.25% of each stocks price each day onwards in rent. A lot when AMC currently is at 15-17 dollars a stock, and they are holding 52 million of them (estimated 27. january). Furthermore 37% of the floating stocks (floating means available for trading and therefore shorting), is owned by institutions who doens't sell their position to the hedges. If we put these numbers together: 100%-37% = 63% left for the shorters to buy back. And they need to buy back between 41-62%, making it almost a 100% effectively at best. Which means that we, the retail investors, effectively have the power to drive the price up potential 40-100$ (some say more, personally im skeptical). Along the week, more of their short positions will run out, making it for an even more expensive short, and then the big squeeze will begin. Maybe late-week, maybe next week.",gllu081,1612220988,2/1/2021 16:09

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö

AMC,there's no need to be scared here at Wall Street bets we are now a focus group with one objective we're not interested in other stocks at Maxine more interesting we don't care we're interested in AMC that's our objective that's where our short squeeze lies and that's where we're going to pull this money back put it back into the hands of those who lost out,gls7a8d,1612329657,2/2/2021 22:20
AMC,REPOST about AMC üëâüèΩ Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 20-30 if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here... COPY AND PASTE SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS,glsat3j,1612330961,2/2/2021 22:42
AMC,"Read this post from AMC board on Yahoo:The available percentage of short shares is now only at 7%. We, as a collective have bought 93% available shares in the float. Once 100% of available shares are being held by investors, hedge funds can no longer short the stock & need to cover. The price is still way above the price they borrowed their shares for. KEEP holding, be patient as there will be a big reward at the end.  


The HF friends got together and are trading the same shares rapidly between each other to keep the price down. The system does not recognize it‚Äôs the same shares that are being traded at high volumes.  


So why is it important for you to hold? The HF need your shares to cover their positions. If you don‚Äôt sell, you limit the ability to cover and they will have to buy at whatever price we set. The longer they wait the more expensive it gets for them. If you are not selling even if the price is low they are not able to cover. Only keep trading the shares between each other. When they run out of time and have to cover this is where the true squeeze happens. Right now they are just trading with each other.",glsbxdq,1612331396,2/2/2021 22:49

AMC,"It's getting close üòéüíé our main goals if we are going to be successful and continue the gamma squeeze we have to break $20 or $25 on Monday or Tuesday! There's a lot of interest at $20, there's 32 thousand contracts open at $20, and there's 46 thousand contracts open at $40. So for the short squeeze to go ahead and continue the stock price has to get over $20 dollars! There's also 7 thousand contracts open at $25. So for us to have the momentum to continue and move forward with the squeeze we must get above $25 on Monday or Tuesday or if not that at least over $20. If we can do that we're really going to put the hurt on these hedges and we should start to see the stock rise dramatically!
To do that though we're all going to have to work together, buy as much AMC stock as you can and hold! We must break those barriers if we are going to be successful!
BUY AND HOLD!

Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

We will be united in our common interests.

Perhaps its fate that today is the 1st of February, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. Our right to BUY stock

And should we win the day, This  will no longer be known as the Rich 1% game, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:

***""We will not go quietly into the night!***

***We will not vanish without a fight!***

***We're going to live on!***

***We're going to survive!""***

***TODAY WE HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!!!!!!!!***

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

They are blatantly manipulating the marketing",gl3q6df,1611876880,1/28/2021 16:34
AMC,"spread the word 

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning.

AMC,"Till now we have fought bravely. Let's take these stock beyond moonüòÅ.
It's our time...don't forget because of these short sellers we common people loose our jobs when a company shuts down operation due to bankruptcy.

These short sellers have played with our lives for years, now it's our time to take back.. what they have snatched from our brothers and sisters.

Now it's time to make AMC to 150$ and GME to 1000$

Shorts will start reacting when AMC will reach 50$ as it happened in case of GME.
So, it's a very good time to enter in AMC, I'm already in with 150k. I have done my part.
There are still over 152k open calls that need to be closed by Friday. Short sellers will need to have at least 15 Million shares to do this. HOLD THE LINE.

Come and join this campaign .

AMC," I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...  


Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.  


(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)  


This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.  


A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).  


As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.  


On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.  


That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.  


The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.  


WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning. COPY AND PASTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH",gl2gyb0,1611854511,1/28/2021 10:21

AMC,"OK LISTEN UP

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.",gkr7cz9,1611640076,1/25/2021 22:47

Robinhood currently blocked the buying option on the volatile stocks, such as NAKD, AMC, GME, NOK. Since people can't buy but can only sell, it is obvious that the price will plummet down.

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",glbjtm9,1612000501,1/30/2021 2:55

AMC,"üö®MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC: üö® It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all. 

They are blatantly manipulating the marketing",gl3om7d,1611876431,1/28/2021 16:27

(Limit Order to sell your positions at $1000 dollars). This means that AMC's stock price could be $20 but if we have limit sells at $1000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit turning one share into $1000 dollars.

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES NEED TO BUY TOMORROW and FRIDAY‚Äî- Let me explain How their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",glwvsrr,1612417396,2/3/2021 22:43
AMC,"The whole reason hedge funds were shorting AMC was because they believed AMC would go bankrupt before the pandemic ended. And they almost succeeded. We helped AMC avoid bankruptcy and that is a blow to hedges who can't get a tax break on those shorts now (I think but really don't know because I'm a retard). We helped save a business we all love. And if a squeeze doesn't happen (and it might not), consider holding out until AMC fully recovers. If you can. Everybody has their own financial choices to make and it's okay if you can't hold out that long. #saveAMC is the real prize and the second best way to fuck hedge funds.",glwz3pe,1612418808,2/3/2021 23:06

So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",glwefxl,1612410281,2/3/2021 20:44

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES NEED TO BUY TOMORROW
 Let me explain How their options contracts work. WITH ******INFO I FOUND HERE
The hedge-funders have a week, THIS WEEK to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 

 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till TOMORROW but some of these contracts haD to be bought by Wednesday. THATS WHY WE SAY POSITIVITY ON WEDNESDAY. They have til TOMORROW to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price . WHICH IS WHAT THEY‚ÄôVE BEEN DOING. Between Wednesday and tomorrow, they‚Äôre were doing everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZEDr‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back.

(Limit Order to sell your positions at $1000 dollars). This means that AMC's stock price could be $20 but if we have limit sells at $1000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit turning one share into $1000 dollars.

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glmfo3z,1612229166,2/1/2021 18:26

AMC,AMC will move but reading some of you panic is pathetic. Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys don't understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon today. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 50+ 100+ if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here...,glpsrgp,1612291256,2/2/2021 11:40

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. ‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. ‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. ‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. ‚Å†What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)
5. ‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)
6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I hope this helps many.",glo98xu,1612255760,2/2/2021 1:49
AMC,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

11) Check (barstool el presidente) David Portnoy‚Äôs videos where he simplified and explains the illegal shit wallstreet is doing. Gotta love this man",gloavom,1612256545,2/2/2021 2:02

AMC, AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING.

On Monday the stock price will go up in the opening and people will start selling once they see they have made some profit.

If we all sell, the big investors will take advantage of this and the war will be over, they will win. If we keep strong and hold positions they will attack and not be able to put the stock down, like on Friday. We need to keep purchasing AMC and hold. If we make this happen, during the week AMC will skyrocket to the moon and we will leave with the pockets full.

FINAL DECISION IS ON US! STAY STRONG AND HOLD! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

UPVOTE SO THAT EVERYBODY SEE THIS!

P.S: fix your limit sell order over $500 or as high as your platform allows. This is what the shorts use to take decisions.

AMC,"I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I hope this helps many.",glo3wap,1612253241,2/2/2021 1:07
AMC,doge is a weekend play when the markets are closed guys. keep with amc while market is open lets run these fuckers up buy and hold!!!,gl8dith,1611955740,1/29/2021 14:29
AMC,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö",glbjia9,1612000347,1/30/2021 2:52

Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

When you buy at pre-market all it does is inflate the price and you‚Äôre shares aren‚Äôt bought yet until the market opens

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding.

Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this.

Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone here did. This means that AMCs stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000 Bad news: The shorts are massive institutions which much more buying power than all of the retail investors Good news: Because AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of tomorrow no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD
Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",gldjm2t,1612050280,1/30/2021 16:44

Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

AMC,"When AMC shorts have increased 50% in the last 2 weeks alone and no shorts covering yet and they're ALL trapped at $2-$5 you could expect it to go up significantly over the next week once shorts are forced to start covering.

AMC,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

(They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

AMC,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect with $AMC this week:

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	‚Å†BUY
2.	‚Å†HOLD
3.	‚Å†BUY MORE
4.	‚Å†HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

AMC,"NASDAQ publishes a report on short positions twice af month. According to sources who has acces to this report, the hedgefond holding AMC shorts (15. january estimated 41%, others on reddit have said 62%, and maybe even more at this time), a unknown percentage of their short was set at 9$, which is why it was important to close above that last friday. This short is said to run out today - meaning they will have to pay 0.25% of each stocks price each day onwards in rent. A lot when AMC currently is at 15-17 dollars a stock, and they are holding 52 million of them (estimated 27. january). Furthermore 37% of the floating stocks (floating means available for trading and therefore shorting), is owned by institutions who doens't sell their position to the hedges. If we put these numbers together: 100%-37% = 63% left for the shorters to buy back. And they need to buy back between 41-62%, making it almost a 100% effectively at best. Which means that we, the retail investors, effectively have the power to drive the price up potential 40-100$ (some say more, personally im skeptical). Along the week, more of their short positions will run out, making it for an even more expensive short, and then the big squeeze will begin. Maybe late-week, maybe next week.",gllu081,1612220988,2/1/2021 16:09

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glmfo3z,1612229166,2/1/2021 18:26

AMC,AMC will move but reading some of you panic is pathetic. Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys don't understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon today. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 50+ 100+ if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here...,glpsrgp,1612291256,2/2/2021 11:40

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. ‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. ‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. ‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. ‚Å†What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)
5. ‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)
6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

AMC,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

11) Check (barstool el presidente) David Portnoy‚Äôs videos where he simplified and explains the illegal shit wallstreet is doing. Gotta love this man",gloavom,1612256545,2/2/2021 2:02

AMC, AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 50+ 100+ if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here...

AMC,REPOST about AMC üëâüèΩ Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING.

On Monday the stock price will go up in the opening and people will start selling once they see they have made some profit.

If we all sell, the big investors will take advantage of this and the war will be over, they will win. If we keep strong and hold positions they will attack and not be able to put the stock down, like on Friday. We need to keep purchasing AMC and hold. If we make this happen, during the week AMC will skyrocket to the moon and we will leave with the pockets full.

FINAL DECISION IS ON US! STAY STRONG AND HOLD! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

UPVOTE SO THAT EVERYBODY SEE THIS!

P.S: fix your limit sell order over $500 or as high as your platform allows. This is what the shorts use to take decisions.

AMC,"I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I hope this helps many.",glo3wap,1612253241,2/2/2021 1:07

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glq8smm,1612302371,2/2/2021 14:46

AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon today?! The hedge funds have mot of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on fro Friday. FACTS: They had until Friday to close BELOW $8.63 and DIDN‚ÄôT DO IT! We closed at $13 which means WE WON! They have a week to cover those contracts, which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. They have to buy some of those by Wednesday. They closed out of the money on Friday and now they have the next several days to to fulfill their contracts and going to re-purchase their shares to return to their lender. They are NOT going to purchase them all at once‚Ä¶this guarantees them a LOSS. Their going to do EVERYTHING they can to push the price down between now and when they have to repay. The longer we KEEP THE PRICE SIDEWAYS the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starting going up as THEY HAVE TO BUY. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding - NOT SELLING. Then you will see $25+ $50+ $100+.

Read info dummies god damn read this

It will eventually surge upwards. Let me explain Hood their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds",glrjpan,1612320402,2/2/2021 19:46

AMC,"AMC KEY INFO: The short interest number is currently 0.71 - this is the ratio given to the HF before they have to cover. When the number hits 0, they have to pay! The further it moves away from zero, the longer this goes on or even risks not happening. Imo, this is the only number that matters. Not the price, the ratio to when they have to sell. 

How do we push this number down? By holding and buying more. This is literally the only way. The short ladder attacks push this number back up, as do any sales back into the hands of HF. As an indicator, the ratio this time last week was 1.44. WE HAVE HALVED THAT NUMBER IN ONE WEEK. If we continue at the current rate of buying and holding, in one weeks time or less, WE WIN.

AMC, [$AMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AMC) Almost 100 million shares traded today already and yet the stock price is staying in the same $6.00 range all morning. They're trying to bait you into selling. This is a last ditch effort. Don't be surprised if shorts start getting closed this afternoon or in afterhours.   The squeeze is going to happen folks.

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME‚Äî‚Äî
They had a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZEDr‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days.

AMC," Not a financial advisor but do understand the markets. $AMC is currently trading at roughly what it should be (if not a bit lower) as they would if they were currently operating theaters. We are literally at the bottom right now. We breathed fresh life into AMC by raising the price to the point where they could sell shares the company owned to stem off the bankruptcy the hedges where counting on. Regardless of the shorting situation, AMC is a solid investment at this price. Selling right now, ESPECIALLY those of you who bought at $15-20 a share is in my opinion foolish even from an investment standpoint. Take the short issue into account as well and we should be all set for a nice payday. Hold the line and this thing should go up.

AMC," [$AMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AMC) They haven't covered. Bots prove that. Soon as one hedgie gives up, the others who have been shorting will fall in line and give up as well. I am convinced they didn't cover all of their positions. Not at 80+ short positions. Never hit the strike price for many of the bets. We would have seen a greater influx if they covered. My guess is they are driving the price down as low as they can go. Attempting to get those to sell.    This page was (is? I blocked all of em) flooded with bot accounts. All bearish. No one is selling. Buy to sell ratio sentiment is still high. Robinhood most held, 94% buy to 6% sell ratio. It's a ticking timebomb. I have patience. Report comes out tonight.

AMC,"WHY THE HEDGES ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME‚Äî‚Äî
They had a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZEDr‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days.

AMC," Not a financial advisor but do understand the markets. $AMC is currently trading at roughly what it should be (if not a bit lower) as they would if they were currently operating theaters. We are literally at the bottom right now. We breathed fresh life into AMC by raising the price to the point where they could sell shares the company owned to stem off the bankruptcy the hedges where counting on. Regardless of the shorting situation, AMC is a solid investment at this price. Selling right now, ESPECIALLY those of you who bought at $15-20 a share is in my opinion foolish even from an investment standpoint. Take the short issue into account as well and we should be all set for a nice payday. Hold the line and this thing should go up.

AMC," [$AMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AMC) They haven't covered. Bots prove that. Soon as one hedgie gives up, the others who have been shorting will fall in line and give up as well. I am convinced they didn't cover all of their positions. Not at 80+ short positions. Never hit the strike price for many of the bets. We would have seen a greater influx if they covered. My guess is they are driving the price down as low as they can go. Attempting to get those to sell.    This page was (is? I blocked all of em) flooded with bot accounts. All bearish. No one is selling. Buy to sell ratio sentiment is still high. Robinhood most held, 94% buy to 6% sell ratio. It's a ticking timebomb. I have patience. Report comes out tonight.

Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying.

Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday.

I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday.

AMC,"It will eventually surge upwards. Let me explain Hood their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds",glrjrpv,1612320427,2/2/2021 19:47

They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glq8smm,1612302371,2/2/2021 14:46

AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon today?! The hedge funds have mot of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on fro Friday. FACTS: They had until Friday to close BELOW $8.63 and DIDN‚ÄôT DO IT! We closed at $13 which means WE WON! They have a week to cover those contracts, which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. They have to buy some of those by Wednesday. They closed out of the money on Friday and now they have the next several days to to fulfill their contracts and going to re-purchase their shares to return to their lender. They are NOT going to purchase them all at once‚Ä¶this guarantees them a LOSS. Their going to do EVERYTHING they can to push the price down between now and when they have to repay. The longer we KEEP THE PRICE SIDEWAYS the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starting going up as THEY HAVE TO BUY. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding - NOT SELLING. Then you will see $25+ $50+ $100+.

It will eventually surge upwards. Let me explain Hood their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and they‚Äôre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So they‚Äôre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if there‚Äôs a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday they‚Äôre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get ‚ÄúSQUEEZED‚Äù at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasn‚Äôt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide when‚Äôs a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds",glrjpan,1612320402,2/2/2021 19:46

The further it moves away from zero, the longer this goes on or even risks not happening. Imo, this is the only number that matters. Not the price, the ratio to when they have to sell. 

How do we push this number down? By holding and buying more. This is literally the only way. The short ladder attacks push this number back up, as do any sales back into the hands of HF. As an indicator, the ratio this time last week was 1.44. WE HAVE HALVED THAT NUMBER IN ONE WEEK. If we continue at the current rate of buying and holding, in one weeks time or less, WE WIN.

AMC,"MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC: It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

They are blatantly manipulating the marketing",gl3q6df,1611876880,1/28/2021 16:34
AMC,"spread the word 

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

AMC,"Till now we have fought bravely. Let's take these stock beyond moonüòÅ.
It's our time...don't forget because of these short sellers we common people loose our jobs when a company shuts down operation due to bankruptcy.

These short sellers have played with our lives for years, now it's our time to take back.. what they have snatched from our brothers and sisters.

Now it's time to make AMC to 150$ and GME to 1000$

Shorts will start reacting when AMC will reach 50$ as it happened in case of GME.
So, it's a very good time to enter in AMC, I'm already in with 150k. I have done my part.
There are still over 152k open calls that need to be closed by Friday. Short sellers will need to have at least 15 Million shares to do this. HOLD THE LINE.

AMC," I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...  


Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.  


(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)  


This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.  


A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).  


As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.  


On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.  


That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.  


The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.  


WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning. COPY AND PASTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH",gl2gyb0,1611854511,1/28/2021 10:21

AMC,So with all the hype around GME and AMC I‚Äôve eased myself off drinking to now entirely clean after being heavily addicted for the past three years. I‚Äôve been waking up at 5 am excited to see the market and I feel like I have a purpose again or at least the spark before the flame of one. That being said when GME hits 1000 I will be getting the rite aid bottle of whiskey from family guy to represent the lowest low I came out of because our you apes  tattooed https://imgur.com/gallery/yFUlBkW,gop19t2,1614281926,2/25/2021 12:38
AMC,"Don't be like me.  Hold.

I sold all my AMC and GME last week in order to free up my capital and ""invest"" in other stocks.

I devolved from ape form in order to be human and lose more money from these said stocks, when I could've just held on with my once diamond hands and added more funds to my account, instead of selling on a 60%/$1000 loss (not so much to the average person, but to a college student, quite a lot no?)

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.  But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.

Alas, It's too late for me, but it's not too late for the rest of yous.  DON'T SELL.  Hold.  Make this shoot out of the Milky Way.  Make the Hedgies pay.  Sing GME shanties if you need to force yourself off the sell button to stay on course.  And I wish each and everyone of you shooting up, and hopefully see you guys shoot past Pluto.

AMC,"Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!!#

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone here did. This means that AMCs stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000 Bad news: The shorts are massive institutions which much more buying power than all of the retail investors Good news: Because AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of tomorrow no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD
Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",gldjm2t,1612050280,1/30/2021 16:44

AMC," 

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",gld7gjx,1612043185,1/30/2021 14:46

Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

AMC,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.",gl461lp,1611881781,1/28/2021 17:56

The volume was low which could be because of people moving away from robinhood and places like that, sites restricting purchases and also a lot of people who weren't diamond hands selling at the start and a lot of day traders. It's a new day though, we should see a bump at pre market again and Tuesdays are usually big days if we get some momentum going analysts are predicting we could close the day around 16 or 17. The problem was the volume and not enough diamond hands! People either getting afraid and selling off or just taking profits, we need to really hold! Tomorrow will be a better day. The hedges are trying to drive the price down as low as they can and start closing because they really don't want a repeat of GME so let's all buy more if we can and hold! We only get were we need to be by holding! The next 2 days are going to be pivotal for AMC! If we can break the 16 barrier and stay above it preferably finish above it its a great sign.

AMC," $AMC....  UPDATE: February 04th, 2021  


What is happening?  
Shorts are ladder attacking the share price back and forth. They've been doing this for a while as we all know. This is illegal for them to do, but the SEC has not done anything about it and likely won't. Is the system rigged? Yes, it is.  


What can we do:  
The share price you see is not technically what the share price should be. The ladder attacks are hedge funds trading shares back and forth between each other which drives the price down. Their goal is to drive the price down using their tactics and ability to do so. The majority of us are buying, not selling. This is good for us because those who bought high can now average down. Do not kid yourself, the Hedge Fund's will continue this for as long as they can to steer you away from buying more, and to convince you to sell. Once you do - they cover. They are not covering with the shares they are trading back and forth. Eventually, these HF's will have to cover and buy back your shares. Yes, this may take longer than you want or expect, but eventually, they WILL give in. When they start buying, they need to increase their bid if people refuse to sell. Eventually, they have to bid up to the lowest price someone will ""ask"" for. This is the significance of HOLDING. Buy, and hold. These cheap prices right now are gold for the retailer.  


The hedge funds are playing serious psychological games that they play to wear down the interests and hype of the stock. Again, do not kid yourself. These guys have billions and will pay good money to learn ways on how to manipulate you and your actions.  


When will the squeeze happen?  
Nobody knows. You cannot ""time the market"". This could happen shortly, or it could happen in a week or two, maybe a month. It all comes down to how long the hedge funds are willing to wait and continue paying interest on their positions. Remember, they need your shares. They can only buy them from you if you are willing to sell them. If everyone just buys and holds, they are stuck. This is the squeeze to force them into buying from you. RIGHT NOW - notice how the share price is flashing back and forth between $7.09 and $6.96 ?? Is that not suspicious ? back and forth? This just proves what they are doing to manipulate.  


Fundamentals:  
AMC is debt free and about to start opening up. That means they are going to start posting revenues in the near future. Why is this important? Because when you have a clean balance sheet of little to no debt and report making good revenue, this looks very very good for the financial world. If a company looks good financially, their stock price will almost always increase. AMC has growth ahead of them which makes this stock worth a lot more than what the ticker shows right now. If you do not need the money - for sure, let this ride for the long run - you WILL make money.  


Charts & More:  
Volkwagen did the same thing as what AMC is doing now. It almost went back to the previous low before it shot up. Do you think Hedge Fund's weren't in the same boat then as they are now? They will try to tank this as much as they can, until they cannot hold on anymore. Eventually, they will pay.  


A $2m dollar $20/call bet was placed the other day. This is an extremely good sign, provided this investor knows something. I don't know about you, but if I were going to wager a $2m bet that this stock was going to be $20 or above by end of February, I'd have done my homework. Based on this alone, I believe this says there is a greater chance that it will, than wont, be $20 or above come end of Feb.  


So, my fellow retail investing friends, the game here is patience. HF can play all the dirty tricks they want but eventually they will break. They cannot afford to be patient, we can. REMEMBER THIS.... AND... HOLD HOLD HOLD!!! PLEASE cut & paste and SHARE EVERYWHERE!!!!",gm2jnp7,1612521736,2/5/2021 3:42

AMC,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö

Eventually they have to cover and if we have stuck together, bought as much as we can and held our shares then they'll be forced to cover at a loss and we'll start to see the prices skyrocket! AMC has limitless potential! Come Monday the fight is on again, buy and hold as much stock as you can to force those hedges to pay a premium! If we do that we all go to the moon!

AMC,"AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise

AMC,REPOST about AMC üëâüèΩ Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 20-30 if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here... COPY AND PASTE SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS,glsat3j,1612330961,2/2/2021 22:42
AMC,"Read this post from AMC board on Yahoo:The available percentage of short shares is now only at 7%. We, as a collective have bought 93% available shares in the float. Once 100% of available shares are being held by investors, hedge funds can no longer short the stock & need to cover. The price is still way above the price they borrowed their shares for. KEEP holding, be patient as there will be a big reward at the end.  


The HF friends got together and are trading the same shares rapidly between each other to keep the price down. The system does not recognize it‚Äôs the same shares that are being traded at high volumes.  


So why is it important for you to hold? The HF need your shares to cover their positions. If you don‚Äôt sell, you limit the ability to cover and they will have to buy at whatever price we set. The longer they wait the more expensive it gets for them. If you are not selling even if the price is low they are not able to cover. Only keep trading the shares between each other. When they run out of time and have to cover this is where the true squeeze happens. Right now they are just trading with each other.",glsbxdq,1612331396,2/2/2021 22:49

So for the short squeeze to go ahead and continue the stock price has to get over $20 dollars! There's also 7 thousand contracts open at $25. So for us to have the momentum to continue and move forward with the squeeze we must get above $25 on Monday or Tuesday or if not that at least over $20. If we can do that we're really going to put the hurt on these hedges and we should start to see the stock rise dramatically!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",gl8yd16,1611963881,1/29/2021 16:44

Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not.

(They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

BB,"**Game 7 in the last decade** 

**2016** - Never was there a higher-stakes Game 7. The Cubs held the longest championship drought in the National League, at 108 years. The Indians held the longest in the American League, at 68 years. The Cubs, in their first World Series since the Second World War, had rallied from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7. The Indians, meanwhile, had lost a heartbreaking Game 7 in 1997, two short years after they had come up just short in 1995. The third try, they hoped, would pay for all. 

Kluber pitched for Cleveland on three day's rest, and almost immediately gave up a lead-off home run to Dexter Fowler. In the bottom of the third, the Indians tied the game on an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the tie was immediately broken by the Cubs in the top of the fourth with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Bryant ran aggressively on the shallow fly, sliding under the ga) and a double by Contreras. Kluber was knocked out an inning later on a Baez homer. Andrew Miller, exhausted from his heavy use that postseason, showed some signs of humanity, giving up a walk and an RBI single (again, Bryant's aggressive baserunning paid off, as he scored from first). 

The Indians knocked out Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth, when he issued a two-out walk. Jon Lester came out in relief, but David Ross committed a throwing error to put runners on second and third. A wild pitch ricocheted of his helmet and allowed two runs to score, narrowing the lead to 5-3. Ross atoned somewhat with a solo shot in the sixth, making the score 6-3.

There the score stood in the 8th inning when Rajai Davis stepped up to bat for Cleveland. Lester had gotten the first two outs, but a single by Jose Ramirez prompted Joe Maddon to bring in Chapman. Chapman, also exhausted, gave up an RBI double to Brandon Guyer, cutting the lead to 6-4. In eleven years, Davis had 55 career home runs. 

That night, he added another, hitting the latest game-tying home run in World Series history. Progressive Field exploded as he rounded the bases. It was the bottom of the 8th inning and Game 7 was *tied*. Both teams held out through the 9th, and Game 7, as it was always going to (it seemed in retrospect) entered extra innings. 

A sudden cloudburst halted play for 17 minutes. The thousands of fans and millions of spectators in their homes waited in nervous tension. Meanwhile, the players descended into their clubhouses, where Jason Heyward reportedly rallied the Cubs.  ""We're the best team in baseball. . . for a reason. . . Stick together and we're going to win this game."" 

In the top of the tenth, they proved Heyward right. Schwarber singled and was replaced by Alberto Almora. Bryant hit a deep fly and Almora tagged, dashing to second. Rizzo was intentionally walked to reach Ben Zobrist - who ripped an RBI double into left field, breaking the tie. Miguel Montero singled home Rizzo, and the Cubs had an 8-6 lead. 

The Indians would not go down without a fight. With two outs, Brandon Guyer reached on a walk, then dashed to second with Davis once again at the plate. Davis couldn't repeat the home run, but he could and did single Guyer home. Game 7 was once again a 1-run game. Michael Montgomery came into face Michael Martinez.

Martinez swung, bounced the ball towards Bryant - and Bryant, with a smile as wide as Christmas on his face, charged in, scooped up the ball, and fired to first base. Three outs. Final score, 8-7, Cubs. For the first time since the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, the Chicago Cubs had won the World Series.

**2014** - Even year magic's final showdown against whatever devil magic the Royals had somehow come up with that wild October. The Royals had dominated the Giants in Game 6, 10-0, and were playing Game 7, at home. The last 9 home teams to force Game 7 had all gone on to win. Everything seemed to favor the Royals. 

Except, perhaps, for Madison Bumgarner. 

Jeremie Guthrie gave up two runs in the top of the second, giving up 3 straight singles to load the bases, then 2 sacrifice flies. Kansas City struck back in the bottom half, as an Alex Gordon double somehow scored the lumbering Billy Butler from first base. Gordon advanced to third on a groundout, then tied the game on a sac fly. The game looked set to go back and forth, and as the innings went on, the bullpen advantage would increasingly tip the advantage to KC. 

But then, in the fourth, the Giants scratched across a third run. A broken-bat single scored Sandoval from third, and the Giants had a 3-2 lead. No matter - the Royals had overcome a 4-run deficit in the Wild Card. The same team, less than a year later, would come back no less than 8 separate times in the postseason, including every World Series game they won. 

But when the bottom half of the fourth came, the Giants bullpen door opened - and out stepped Madison Bumgarner. 

It was only two days of rest. He had just pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5. No matter. His team had entrusted him with a 1-run lead in Game 7 of the World Series, and he would defend it. MadBum gave up a single to Infante, then settled in and retired the next 14 Royals in a row. 

The KC bullpen kept the game scoreless, and tension mounted in Kauffman as the innings drew on. Inning by inning, out by out, pitch by pitch the Giants' ace labored. Sweat poured off his face. He was breathing hard with exertion, as his total pitch count for the World Series reached 250 and continued to climb. But he did not yield. 

At last, in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, a breakthrough. Gordon singled - and then the Giants' outfield misplayed the ball. The Royals outfielder had not been running hard to first, but when he saw the error he dug hard and scorched into third. The stadium crowd started to roar. Did KC have one last miracle comeback in them? At the plate was Salvador Perez, the only man who had scored off Madbum in the World Series. If he could do the same here, he woudl win the game and the Series in one swing of the bat. 

Well, we all know what happened. Bumgarner threw nothing but fastballs, high and inside. Salvy couldn't help himself but swing. He fell behind in the count, fought off one pitch, offered at another - and popped it foul to Sandoval, in foul territory, for the third out. The Giants sealed even year magic and won their 3rd championship in 5 years. Madison Bumgarner was rightly proclaimed the MVP. 

**2011** - After the wild ride that was Game 6, it seemed inevitable that Game 7 would disappoint. At first, though, it looked to be yet another shootout between the Rangers and the Cardinals. Chris Carpenter  - making his third start that Series - yielded two RBI doubles in the first inning, making the score 2-0 Texas. 

Unfortunately for the Rangers, those were the last two runs they have scored in the World Series to date.

David Freese (who else) tied the game in the bottom of the first with a 2-run double, then in the third Allen Craig hit the go-ahead homer. Without a hit in the fifth inning, the Cardinals piled two more runs on. Yadi walked with the bases loaded, then C. J. Wilson relieved Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch. To complete the dissolution of the Rangers, Craig robbed a home run from Nelson Cruz in the sixth. In the seventh, Berkmann singled home another run for St. Louis to make it 6-2 Cardinals. 

Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.",dp7qcxe,1509608334,11/2/2017 1:38

But you know who was always there for me when I needed another controller because my friends were coming over after school and I wanted us to 4 way split screen some Halo 3 on the 15 year old tube TV upstairs? Gamestop.

Who started expanding their inventory in the last few years to include more stuff from other hobbies I enjoy like Gundam model kits and board games? Gamestop.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

BB,"OK LISTEN UP

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

BB,"ELI5: How Shorts Work
  
Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren‚Äôt really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
‚ÄúWell, this is too expensive!‚Äù, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  ‚ÄúI simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.‚Äù
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
‚ÄúExcuse me, good sir? Don‚Äôt you want to buy this game? It‚Äôs all the rage!‚Äù He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he‚Äôd only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn‚Äôt too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When‚Äôs the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn‚Äôt happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn‚Äôt worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn‚Äôt owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn‚Äôt count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn‚Äôt worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that‚Äôs when he realized. It‚Äôs not about the game. It‚Äôs about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",gkx68bb,1611758346,1/27/2021 7:39
BB,"#LISTEN UP - DROP SOME INFO FOR YOU VETERANS.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

BB,"OK LISTEN UP

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",gl6r3cd,1611919237,1/29/2021 4:20

BB,"ELI5: How Shorts Work
  
Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren‚Äôt really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
‚ÄúWell, this is too expensive!‚Äù, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  ‚ÄúI simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.‚Äù
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
‚ÄúExcuse me, good sir? Don‚Äôt you want to buy this game? It‚Äôs all the rage!‚Äù He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he‚Äôd only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn‚Äôt too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When‚Äôs the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn‚Äôt happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn‚Äôt worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn‚Äôt owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn‚Äôt count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn‚Äôt worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that‚Äôs when he realized. It‚Äôs not about the game. It‚Äôs about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",gkx68bb,1611758346,1/27/2021 7:39
BB,"#LISTEN UP - DROP SOME INFO FOR YOU VETERANS.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

#IN RETARD SPEAK - THESE GUYS ARE TAKING ACTIVE AND DECEITFUL MEASURES TODAY TO GET OUT BEFORE THE BOMB THAT IS GOING TO HIT AT MARKET CLOSE TODAY.  DO NOT BE FUCKING DUPED.

BB,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",gl6r3cd,1611919237,1/29/2021 4:20

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

BB,"**Game 7 in the last decade** 

**2016** - Never was there a higher-stakes Game 7. The Cubs held the longest championship drought in the National League, at 108 years. The Indians held the longest in the American League, at 68 years. The Cubs, in their first World Series since the Second World War, had rallied from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7. The Indians, meanwhile, had lost a heartbreaking Game 7 in 1997, two short years after they had come up just short in 1995. The third try, they hoped, would pay for all. 

Kluber pitched for Cleveland on three day's rest, and almost immediately gave up a lead-off home run to Dexter Fowler. In the bottom of the third, the Indians tied the game on an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the tie was immediately broken by the Cubs in the top of the fourth with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Bryant ran aggressively on the shallow fly, sliding under the ga) and a double by Contreras. Kluber was knocked out an inning later on a Baez homer. Andrew Miller, exhausted from his heavy use that postseason, showed some signs of humanity, giving up a walk and an RBI single (again, Bryant's aggressive baserunning paid off, as he scored from first). 

The Indians knocked out Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth, when he issued a two-out walk. Jon Lester came out in relief, but David Ross committed a throwing error to put runners on second and third. A wild pitch ricocheted of his helmet and allowed two runs to score, narrowing the lead to 5-3. Ross atoned somewhat with a solo shot in the sixth, making the score 6-3.

There the score stood in the 8th inning when Rajai Davis stepped up to bat for Cleveland. Lester had gotten the first two outs, but a single by Jose Ramirez prompted Joe Maddon to bring in Chapman. Chapman, also exhausted, gave up an RBI double to Brandon Guyer, cutting the lead to 6-4. In eleven years, Davis had 55 career home runs. 

That night, he added another, hitting the latest game-tying home run in World Series history. Progressive Field exploded as he rounded the bases. It was the bottom of the 8th inning and Game 7 was *tied*. Both teams held out through the 9th, and Game 7, as it was always going to (it seemed in retrospect) entered extra innings. 

A sudden cloudburst halted play for 17 minutes. The thousands of fans and millions of spectators in their homes waited in nervous tension. Meanwhile, the players descended into their clubhouses, where Jason Heyward reportedly rallied the Cubs.  ""We're the best team in baseball. . . for a reason. . . Stick together and we're going to win this game."" 

In the top of the tenth, they proved Heyward right. Schwarber singled and was replaced by Alberto Almora. Bryant hit a deep fly and Almora tagged, dashing to second. Rizzo was intentionally walked to reach Ben Zobrist - who ripped an RBI double into left field, breaking the tie. Miguel Montero singled home Rizzo, and the Cubs had an 8-6 lead. 

The Indians would not go down without a fight. With two outs, Brandon Guyer reached on a walk, then dashed to second with Davis once again at the plate. Davis couldn't repeat the home run, but he could and did single Guyer home. Game 7 was once again a 1-run game. Michael Montgomery came into face Michael Martinez.

Martinez swung, bounced the ball towards Bryant - and Bryant, with a smile as wide as Christmas on his face, charged in, scooped up the ball, and fired to first base. Three outs. Final score, 8-7, Cubs. For the first time since the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, the Chicago Cubs had won the World Series.

**2014** - Even year magic's final showdown against whatever devil magic the Royals had somehow come up with that wild October. The Royals had dominated the Giants in Game 6, 10-0, and were playing Game 7, at home. The last 9 home teams to force Game 7 had all gone on to win. Everything seemed to favor the Royals. 

Except, perhaps, for Madison Bumgarner. 

Jeremie Guthrie gave up two runs in the top of the second, giving up 3 straight singles to load the bases, then 2 sacrifice flies. Kansas City struck back in the bottom half, as an Alex Gordon double somehow scored the lumbering Billy Butler from first base. Gordon advanced to third on a groundout, then tied the game on a sac fly. The game looked set to go back and forth, and as the innings went on, the bullpen advantage would increasingly tip the advantage to KC. 

But then, in the fourth, the Giants scratched across a third run. A broken-bat single scored Sandoval from third, and the Giants had a 3-2 lead. No matter - the Royals had overcome a 4-run deficit in the Wild Card. The same team, less than a year later, would come back no less than 8 separate times in the postseason, including every World Series game they won. 

But when the bottom half of the fourth came, the Giants bullpen door opened - and out stepped Madison Bumgarner. 

It was only two days of rest. He had just pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5. No matter. His team had entrusted him with a 1-run lead in Game 7 of the World Series, and he would defend it. MadBum gave up a single to Infante, then settled in and retired the next 14 Royals in a row. 

The KC bullpen kept the game scoreless, and tension mounted in Kauffman as the innings drew on. Inning by inning, out by out, pitch by pitch the Giants' ace labored. Sweat poured off his face. He was breathing hard with exertion, as his total pitch count for the World Series reached 250 and continued to climb. But he did not yield. 

At last, in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, a breakthrough. Gordon singled - and then the Giants' outfield misplayed the ball. The Royals outfielder had not been running hard to first, but when he saw the error he dug hard and scorched into third. The stadium crowd started to roar. Did KC have one last miracle comeback in them? At the plate was Salvador Perez, the only man who had scored off Madbum in the World Series. If he could do the same here, he woudl win the game and the Series in one swing of the bat. 

Well, we all know what happened. Bumgarner threw nothing but fastballs, high and inside. Salvy couldn't help himself but swing. He fell behind in the count, fought off one pitch, offered at another - and popped it foul to Sandoval, in foul territory, for the third out. The Giants sealed even year magic and won their 3rd championship in 5 years. Madison Bumgarner was rightly proclaimed the MVP. 

**2011** - After the wild ride that was Game 6, it seemed inevitable that Game 7 would disappoint. At first, though, it looked to be yet another shootout between the Rangers and the Cardinals. Chris Carpenter  - making his third start that Series - yielded two RBI doubles in the first inning, making the score 2-0 Texas. 

Unfortunately for the Rangers, those were the last two runs they have scored in the World Series to date.

David Freese (who else) tied the game in the bottom of the first with a 2-run double, then in the third Allen Craig hit the go-ahead homer. Without a hit in the fifth inning, the Cardinals piled two more runs on. Yadi walked with the bases loaded, then C. J. Wilson relieved Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch. To complete the dissolution of the Rangers, Craig robbed a home run from Nelson Cruz in the sixth. In the seventh, Berkmann singled home another run for St. Louis to make it 6-2 Cardinals. 

Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.",dp7qcxe,1509608334,11/2/2017 1:38

BB,"Can I just take a moment to say that above learned more about the actual stock market since January than I have in the entire preceding year. As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life.

I was constantly on the sub reading about everyone else and their journey. I was up $25,000. Yeah, fucking $25,000. Now, for some of you, that‚Äôs not a lot.

BB,"Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!!#

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

BB,"Can I just take a moment to say that above learned more about the actual stock market since January than I have in the entire preceding year. As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh.

GME,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö",glbjia9,1612000347,1/30/2021 2:52

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",gl8yd16,1611963881,1/29/2021 16:44

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",gl90648,1611964522,1/29/2021 16:55

It's a new day though, we should see a bump at pre market again and Tuesdays are usually big days if we get some momentum going analysts are predicting we could close the day around 16 or 17. The problem was the volume and not enough diamond hands! People either getting afraid and selling off or just taking profits, we need to really hold! Tomorrow will be a better day. The hedges are trying to drive the price down as low as they can and start closing because they really don't want a repeat of GME so let's all buy more if we can and hold!

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",glbjtm9,1612000501,1/30/2021 2:55

GME,"**Read 
I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I hope this helps many.",glphjqc,1612281207,2/2/2021 8:53

\-DFV told congress and the entire nation during the last hearing he still thinks GME is attractive at then-current price and outlined why(opportunity for pivot, once industry leaders in gaming, etc.).

\-They didn't believe him, so with steel balls a'swinging he doubled down and bought 50K more shares of GME

\-Yesterday Gamestop CFO resigned, which is excellent news because he's part of the old guard that almost let Gamestop fade into non-existence. New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!

There's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now

GME,"Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of üíéüñê who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. üíéüñê need to understand this and help all the üßªüñê retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",gol32rg,1614206085,2/24/2021 15:34

**THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SQUEEZE YET, PATIENCE AND DIAMOND HANDS REQUIRED**

The price shot up massively yesterday, true. But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.

But I think its essential to remember this

**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**

In a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.

**This is NOT what is happening now.**
The price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down 

**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**

UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.

**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**

Dont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.

GME,"Brokerages are still ""choosing"" what limit orders are allowed.

&#x200B;

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

GME,"Holy shit! I honestly didn't believe in this anymore. I gave up. Honest to god I gave up on this stock. I was like, yea that sucks guess I'll just have to hold onto it for fucking ever and maybe one day I can get my money back. I was down so hard. I do not have money. I am a poor motherfucker and I yolo'd everything I could spare. 150 dollars. Into GME. I borrowed another 70 from a friend just so I could get 2 at 110. And I honestly didn't care if it took off or not. I simply wanted to watch wall street sweat and be a part of the movement that shed light on the shady shit that goes on there. I was totally prepared to watch it ride to zero and just count it as the cost of revolution. So I've held this whole time. I considered averaging down at $43 but I really couldn't afford it if it tanked further so I didn't.

I was one of the late joining bag holders. It took me a while to get my fidelity account setup and ready I wanted in before Jan 27/28 but couldn't get my funds approved and transferred and settled before then. This is giving me hope again. Hope that I'll recoup my investment in addition to the exposure that came from this which was my real reason for getting into it. Yea I wanted to make some money too but, I'd never considered stocks before this. Thank you retards so much for all the posts these last weeks. I lurk here and read and rarely post. Sincerely hope this takes off and I can make at least what I put into it and maybe more! Ty so much guys! Obligatory Rocket Emjois!

GME,"Copying from u/[DiggingDeeperDaily](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiggingDeeperDaily/): THIS IS WHY WE HOLD. STOP SELLING

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",gkqcmvu,1611626400,1/25/2021 19:00

GME,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

GME,"If you've never bought stock before, this is all probably confusing. GameStop can't really be headed to $1,000/share, right?


Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

GME,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

United, we are strong, but the moment we start selling is the moment we leave people behind. 

The system has been rigged against not just us investors in this sub but as a cultural and social thing too. This COULD be everyone on earth. Why does the 1% have so much money while we work our entire lives to basically just get by? 

If you‚Äôre paying your school loans back, house loans, car loans, etc with this stock, if this stock being this high and this community being united makes you happy, think of all the other people in the world that could be doing the same. 

This isn‚Äôt about stocks or money anymore imo honestly like I said, I only have a few shares. This is about waking up, showing not only the big boy firms out there that we matter and can take control if we unite, but we‚Äôre also showing everyday people like you and me that we can go so far if we just stick together.

GME,"Up until last week I kinda hated GameStop. I spent so much money there in high school and the trade in value sucked so hard I just started hunting for deals online and if I wanted to sell a game I made the effort to put it on eBay so I could get 10 bucks back on my 50 dollar game instead of getting 2 bucks of in-store credit. 

But you know who was always there for me when I needed another controller because my friends were coming over after school and I wanted us to 4 way split screen some Halo 3 on the 15 year old tube TV upstairs? Gamestop.

Who had the Rocket League merch in stock so I could grab some on the way to my nephew's birthday party last year? Gamestop.

Who started expanding their inventory in the last few years to include more stuff from other hobbies I enjoy like Gundam model kits and board games? Gamestop.

If GameStop is going to die let them die because the people have stopped shopping there. Don't let these hedgefund fucks kill GME before they have a chance at redemption. **No one gets to kill GameStop but us.**

GME,"Real talk, this is the power of numbers in momentum trading. The shorts have backed themselves into a corner. The news anchors are talking about ""fundamentals,"" but I have some fundamentals to tell you about. There is a finite amount of supply, and more demand than that supply. If we refuse to give them the supply, then the price goes up. GME is worth however much we believe it to be worth. Doesn't matter what the ""fundamentals"" of the company are. If I woke up tomorrow, and all of us truly believed that GME was worth 10K then it would hit 10K easy. Nobody would be selling, and everyone would be buying in on this massive discount. It's about the psychology. Wall street is using scare tactics to try and make that belief waver. They want you to believe that GME might only be worth 1K, or 300, or 30 based on ""fundamentals."" They want you to think you're late to the party. They want you to think that we're all a bunch of cowards who are going to cash out on the first dip and crash the price. They want you to think Friday is the endgame. But let me ask you. If there exists short sellers who NEED to close, and nobody is willing to sell the stock under 10K, what do you think will happen? If we hold we win. Stay strong boys. Buy the dips and hold. To fucking andromeda.

GME,"Some of you are just here for the tendies and that's fine. But as I bought some GME and got more involved in posting and reading, I realized this isn't about tendies...this is about standing up against a rigged system that steals our hard earned money.

I don't know when or how this ends and maybe I get burned at the end of the day holding the bag but we've raised awareness across the globe of the greed and flawed system. People are noticing. Not just normies like me and you, but wealthy individuals like Chamath, Elon and El Presidente Dave Portnoy and may others. Politicians like AOC are tweeting about it. 

This will all be worth it because they now know the power of the people and we won't back down to their scare tactics and rigging.

If they want to keep playing this game, we can play too (if we want). The choice is ours now. We gave up way too much power last year begging for $600 dollars after 8 months while they collected paychecks and laughed behind our backs.

But guess who is pretending not to notice? The suits that use this rigged system to take our money. The media personalities that are calling us stupid and market manipulators. We aren't manipulating anything. We are free independent investors that see truth from fiction. 

Melvin is the poster child of what not to do. Scott Wapner is the defender of this rigged system and deserves a place on the wall too.

GME,"$GME has made me want to quit my job. And not because of tendies.
But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

GME,"In November of 2006, I managed to get my hands on a Wii Console. They were gold dust. I played it a bit but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii‚Äôs were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

GME,"So many new users, so few posts explaining what's happening. This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

‚ÄúFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn‚Äôt just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

GME,"Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are 310 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

GME,"Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!!#

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

FOR SEC: EVERYTHING I AM SAYING IS AN ACCOUNT PURELY OF FICTION. ANY PERCEIVED SUGGESTIONS, DEMANDS, OR STOCK TRADING ADVICE IS PURELY A FANTASTIC EXERCISE WITH NO BASIS IN REALITY. THIS IS NOT AN STOCK INVESTMENT BOARD, IT IS FULL OF MEMES AND COMEDY/PARODY ACCOUNTS.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO üíé ü§≤ AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

GME,"there is no dump. GME isn't rising on a pump and dump, it's rising on a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze. hedge funds who shorted GME are the unironic version of ""price hits x and the shotgun goes off"" meme on a massive scale right now.

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

GME,"To the paperhands and newbros joining us. To those who joined us at a high this morning. To those who are losing money because they joined us at 150. Here's what you want to know. Here's what you need to know.

&#x200B;

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70. Today your hearts and those short selling un-American sons of bitches banking on an American company failing are screaming ""It won't make it back to 100, sell"". And you turn to WSB as this is where it all began for you. You look for help. You look for a sign. Here's your answer.

GME,"To everyone who doesn‚Äôt understand GME and what‚Äôs happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on. 

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so let‚Äôs start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it‚Äôs going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don‚Äôt want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

I‚Äôve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday‚Äôs... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. 


NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow. 

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently. 

Best of luck my fellow retard.",gkrtpei,1611651360,1/26/2021 1:56
GME," 

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

GME,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

To the paper hands selling, I strongly suggest you research ""Short Squeeze"" and also research whats happening with GME and similar. Big money buying puts (puts are a loan), they HAVE to buy the stock in the future. That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.

>That means 3 or 4 squeezes in succession at higher and higher rates. Let me say this again- there will be more than one squeeze and maybe up to 4.

>I went into this thinking that $420 or even $690 was just meme bullshit. After looking at this I
don‚Äôt know how a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze stays below 4-digits.
Here is some proof of this point ‚Äì it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.
Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let‚Äôs go back again to the available
float 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been
traded 5 times. There‚Äôs just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know
DFV didn‚Äôt sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didn‚Äôt get sold and bought 5
times. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.

>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer
shares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on
gamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to
cover their calls. But there weren‚Äôt enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to
close a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again. (The dips in volume on
the chart were the halts during trading)

GME,"Today‚Äôs GME Action Explained

Today was less a short squeeze and more a continuation of the Gamma Squeeze we experienced on Friday. Lots of other DD regarding that, but a lot of it has to do with the clearinghouse and share settlements that all happened today.

Look for next week to potentially repeat this as Thursday and Friday, investors will probably pile into $115c 0DTE options and will cause a similar gamma squeeze.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

No financial advice here. Just sharing thoughts.

If you held through today, it was glorious and painful. I saw money I never thought I‚Äôd see and then I lost it all the same.

GME,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect with $AMC this week:

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	‚Å†BUY
2.	‚Å†HOLD
3.	‚Å†BUY MORE
4.	‚Å†HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö

You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation. United under $GME, until the fat cats fall.",gkxbiuk,1611762670,1/27/2021 8:51

‚Ä¢ We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

‚Ä¢ The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

‚Ä¢ WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Don't let them bully, scare, or manipulate you into selling for a PENNY less than what you COULD get at the highest point betwee now and 2030.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

GME,"Also, found this in one of the other stock subreddits:  

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

GME,"spread the word 

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

Melvin, Shitron, and company  will keep this going because it's going to be like 100x more expensive to just give in and they think we will run out of steam or get bored. 

Little do they know is I'm all in.  I eat crayons, stick my finger in electrical sockets, and lick windows.  This is our time.  We buy every dip they throw at us with our 2.3583 shares in our dinky Robinhood accounts.  

They will come hard at us today.  We are fucking with their ability to manipulate the market but we have a vision that they don't.  We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.  It's about creating higher lows each dip.  


  I am a mouth breather who can't stop üõë, won't stop üõë, GameStop üöÄüíéüß§üöÄüíéüß§üöÄüíéüß§ üöÄüíéüß§ üöÄ  ***Don't listen to me.  I eat crayons and this is not financial advice 

Edit: for those asking my hands are blue because they have been diamonds for so long

Edit 2:  Dont you sell yet.....moon or nothing

Edit 3: Dont you sell.....I know you.....you are thinking about it.  You are up 100%.  This never happens to you.  This is life changing money......no you sit on your dumb hands.  Ask your wife's boyfriend to hold you down like he does to her.  You fucking sit and wait.....it's not over yet

Edit 4:. 48.50 is our new support.  Get in fellow crayon eaters lol

Edit 5:. You smooth brained üß† idiots are doing it.  Got options sell and buy more shares.  Don't you fucking sell.  52 our new support.  Dont let it dip

Edit 6: Someone actually asked me about it being over bought on the RSI.  Dude.  It's to the moon. This thing should be a 90s on the 1 hour RSI.  

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit 7:. Updates.  So we hit big sell wall around 75.  They are fucking scared and they pushed it down and shut down the breakers.  Good.  Now don't get scared.  Don't paper hands.  Now we buy the dip and they will say fuckkmmmeeee.  

Edit 8: 60 is the new support. Hold this line and buy.  Like trench warfare we are advancing and they know they are fucked.  Keep the faith and diamond hands.  Buy more commons.  Sell your options.  You made enough.  We need your help prying away shares from them with people that will hold forever.

Let dooooo iiittttr!

GME,"That was a margin call
The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

GME,"That was a margin call The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

I almost had pity for him, until he started boasting how big his institution is and how we should fear him for that. Man this guy deserves no pity. He's so used to manipulating the market easily, it makes him truly believe he's entitled to it and can win no matter what Mr. Market says.

GME," 

I hate to have to repost this however we need to spread AWARENESS on the issue of Market Manipulation and the current events. No, I AM NOT A BOT. I am a real person that lives in a cold dark room with my dog and I haven't showered in 5 weeks. I'm kidding! but I am Canadian. I am also in college so i don't have the fucking time to respond differently to every post. IM SORRY. But you all need to know this information.

GME IS NOT OVER! They are turning the average AUTIST into smooth brains!! This is true that bots have taken over WSB. This is true that bots with many awards bought by the hedge funds have taken over. WE MUST STAND TOGETHER. THIS VIDEO WILL EXPLAIN ALL YOUR DOUBTS!! üíéüôåüíé

In the following weeks, GME has plummeted. I will not deny that this week has been rough for everyone, including myself. The price had the appearance of everyone selling however my belief is that **phantom shares** are being brought into the market which in turn are being sold for less hence driving the price lower. To all the paper hand bitches; they also contributed a bit to the price being driven down. Now, I have linked a video that goes into thorough detail on why this is not over. It's not just showing graphs and discussing the trends, it goes over ALL THE EVENTS that have happened and the EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE '**SQUOOZE** of the **SQUEEZE'**. The HEDGE FUNDS are trying to scare us into selling. THESE BOTS are trying to make us sell. THESE ACCOUNTS(BOTS) can be BOUGHT and to manipulate US! FOR SOME, it is WORKING! Some of these accounts have so many awards blah blah blah, but none of them are OG WSB members!

Also, search up on youtube: **GROW TO ATTAIN**, the latest video on phantom shares will clear up everything for you and what to expect. So far, this is all in our favor if we keep holding or buying shares!

ALSO, look AT THAT LINK I POSTED, IT WILL CLEAR UP MANY THINGS FOR YOU! ALL POSITIVES FOR HOLD GANG, 400 GANG, 300 GANG, 200, 100, 5 GANG.

Also to all the new WSB members, welcome! Some of these posts are TOXIC, though WSB's goal HAS NOT CHANGED; AUTISTS/APES are taking that rocket ship and shoving it into Uranus. This means, if you want in the action, you must decide to get your ticket. Just make sure you don't put your money for College/University (I wonder what happened to that guy/girl) or life savings, this is a very volatile stock. Just know that you either are a paper handed bitch, or a diamond hand BAMF. üíéüôåüíé Once this rocket leaves the lithosphere, we ain't coming back to pick up the stragglers. So GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL HOLDING! APES STAND TOGETHER AND WE SHALL PREVAIL! Also, FEB 9th is coming up, IMPORTANT DAY! Mark it on your calendars! Check out this video for the reason why it's important, plus an explanation on why we have NOT lost the war! THE BATTLE THIS WEEK, WE LOST, HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T WON THE WAR!

Also, rest up, hydrate, and be prepared for the weeks to come. We shall have our movie, with a happy ending!

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you what to do with your money. I'm just an APE who likes this stock!! üíéüôåüíé

I would also post the to the WSB Forum, however, my karma level is too low/they won't allow me to post for some reason, I would post it there too if I could. I can‚Äôt even make a post on this forum either!

I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT KARMA POINTS, IF YOU CAN POST THIS ON WSB AND IT BLOWS UP IDGAF. JUST SPREAD THE WORD TO OTHERS AND THE ""RIGHT"" INFORMATION!",gmb0giu,1612686907,2/7/2021 1:35

Alright animals, I am here to offer some comfort in these trying times. The TLDR of this is - HOLD, this is the bumpy, exciting, volatile beginning of our tendie launch.

I get that some of you have never had gains so high (shit, I haven‚Äôt - I could‚Äôve had a heart attack because of premarket gains) but the fact of the matter is, if you HOLD now, you will BENEFIT later.

GME,"there is no dump. GME isn't rising on a pump and dump, it's rising on a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze. hedge funds who shorted GME are the unironic version of ""price hits x and the shotgun goes off"" meme on a massive scale right now.

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

See it drop to $66: Freak out and either sell or pray it goes up a little bit so you can either break even or only take a small loss

Slow rise to $115: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been holding this for so long, better sell now while I have the chance‚Äù

It‚Äôs why institutions make money and people like us lose the game.

I didn't sell today. I  saw my truck being paid off and a good chunk of my house. I saw a year of living expenses and getting ahead on my student loans.

I didn't sell today. I've paper handed this stock two times at $13 and $41 to pay bills with little profit. Never did I think that I would be fortunate enough to actually get ahead in life by making a good financial decision against the whales.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70.

GME,"To everyone who doesn‚Äôt understand GME and what‚Äôs happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on. 

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so let‚Äôs start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it‚Äôs going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don‚Äôt want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

I‚Äôve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday‚Äôs... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life.

GME," 

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

I own 111 GME shares @ $53.

I don't do options because I am but a simple man.

I'm holding till the only thing left of the shorts is the outline of their shadows on a wall.

GME,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes. 


Now do it again tomorrow.  And keep doing it until they break.",gkqq3m3,1611632261,1/25/2021 20:37

To the paper hands selling, I strongly suggest you research ""Short Squeeze"" and also research whats happening with GME and similar. Big money buying puts (puts are a loan), they HAVE to buy the stock in the future. That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.

Today's peak was a 150% increase over Friday and the squeeze hasn't even started. If the squeeze starts, we can assume the days will end closer to the day peak because of the upward trajectory as shorts continue to unwind.

80-200 = 150% 

200-500 = 150% 

500-1250 = 150%

If the squeeze begins, a 150% increase is going to be easy, considering it happened without the squeeze even starting.
 
Day 1: 80-200 

Day 2: 200-500

squeezes. The first one is the earthquake, the second one is the fucking tsunami that hits and
wipes out the shorters in fucking biblical fashion.

>There are some analysts who are far better at this than I am and they believe the true
amount of shorts to real available shares is 300%-400%. If that‚Äôs the case then you‚Äôre looking
at brokers closing a short position 3 to 4 times on the same share- meaning some fucking
shorters somewhere are going to have to buy that same stock 3 or 4 times at market price.

>That means 3 or 4 squeezes in succession at higher and higher rates. Let me say this again- there will be more than one squeeze and maybe up to 4.

>I went into this thinking that $420 or even $690 was just meme bullshit. After looking at this I
don‚Äôt know how a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze stays below 4-digits.
Here is some proof of this point ‚Äì it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.
Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let‚Äôs go back again to the available
float 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been
traded 5 times. There‚Äôs just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know
DFV didn‚Äôt sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didn‚Äôt get sold and bought 5
times. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.

>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer
shares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on
gamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to
cover their calls. But there weren‚Äôt enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to
close a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again. (The dips in volume on
the chart were the halts during trading)

Today was less a short squeeze and more a continuation of the Gamma Squeeze we experienced on Friday. Lots of other DD regarding that, but a lot of it has to do with the clearinghouse and share settlements that all happened today.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

GME,"/u/Unlucky-Prize, you've had some of the best written and most thorough DD on this thing the whole way through, even from the opposite side. Way better arguments presented than Citron had.

1 of 2 things will happen now. 

1. Like you said, Bears finally start cutting their losses before further bleeding, or...

2. You have magical inverse factors, and GME collapses right as you close your put positions, taking all of us with you. You believe up, it goes down. You believe down, it goes up. We start an inverse Unlucky-Prize fund and cut you a cool 25% and we all retire the richest autists to date before 2022.

I'm leaning heavily on #1. FOMO has just started to reach hesitant boomers and novices. Hell, /r/stocks is moving in Monday. 

I give the bubble 1-2 weeks, but have no problem missing and holding long with my shares given I got in early enough and do have high hopes for the future of GME under Cohen and co.",gkh98hn,1611481283,1/24/2021 2:41

GME,"I was actually more in agreement with the conclusions in your previous posts than this one. My theory: This is showing more hallmarks of Blue Apron squeeze than a short squeeze.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.

**Long term**

* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B. But that will take time, patience and legit üíéüëê that most don't have.


All in all, this was incredible to witness and be a part of. Only wish I had the balls to play calls along with shares.

GME,"even though I disagreed with your previous post, it is clear you know way more about markets than I do, and I appreciate you taking the time to write this. I'm learning a lot.

I can see ways in this can go very badly if some big dick hedge fund manager decides its time to swing. How much will retail endure if they take -50% in one day ? Not everyone here is DFV and there are a lot of late joiners.

But overall, the buying pressure has been so relentless that without a serious shock, I don't see a trend reversal soon.  I don't even think the 100M USD offer from GME they have pre-approved would quench the thirst.

if not much but shorts calmly covering over the next two weeks happens, that still takes us from 117 to 69 M shares, which is a GME at 110 and change.  ( if they haven't started covering yet)",gkl44sp,1611531402,1/24/2021 16:36

GME,"Copying from u/[DiggingDeeperDaily](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiggingDeeperDaily/): THIS IS WHY WE HOLD. STOP SELLING

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",gkqcmvu,1611626400,1/25/2021 19:00

GME,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

GME,"If you've never bought stock before, this is all probably confusing. GameStop can't really be headed to $1,000/share, right?


Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",glbjtm9,1612000501,1/30/2021 2:55

They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCK

KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

GME,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

GME,"$GME has made me want to quit my job. And not because of tendies.
But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

GME," SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii‚Äôs were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

GME,"Things everyone should know:

1) Friday may not be the day. Shorts DO NOT HAVE TO COVER. There is no expiration on those, unless the institution that lent them those shares demands that they cover.

2) Calls that expire Friday do NOT need to be covered by institutions until the next week Mon/Tues (they have 3 days). So even that massive open interest that's ITM may not spur huge movements until next week. Stay patient.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

‚ÄúFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",gl6r3cd,1611919237,1/29/2021 4:20

GME,"For the bears saying GME will only go to $1000, let me walk you through a little thought exercise. Say your name is Vince. You turned 62 this year. You have five beautiful children, six cars, a dozen properties and three homes. You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation.

‚Ä¢ We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

‚Ä¢ The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

‚Ä¢ WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Don't let them bully, scare, or manipulate you into selling for a PENNY less than what you COULD get at the highest point betwee now and 2030.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

I‚Äôm going to say this once more to try and calm all the panic sellers down. THE NEWS YOU ARE READING ABOUT MELVIN IS COMING FROM A PHONECALL THAT ISN‚ÄôT EVEN TRUE.

This is the perfect time to buy a dip. Don‚Äôt believe me? Come back to this comment at 4:00 EST today. Elon has shilled it. Chamath has invested into CALLS FOR FUCK SAKE NOT EVEN SHARES.

GME,"Also, found this in one of the other stock subreddits:  

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

GME,"**REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES**

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Don't sell, a lot of OTM calls are expiring on Friday. The best is yet to come. 
* Most of us in here are not day traders. You're kidding yourself if you think you can ""time the wave"" just right and sell at the high, then buy back in at the low. Even professional traders don't know what they are doing half the time.
* You only get hurt if you jump off a rollercoaster. In this case, imagine how screwed you will be if you jump off a rocket ship as it's accelerating into space.
* Lastly, don't stay up at night imaging what could have been. Who cares that you didn't notice the story until a few days ago, or that you didn't buy more at this time or sell at that time. You're in for the ride now. No one knows where exactly this will go, but 99.9 percent of us know it's going up considering almost everyone in here is doing yolo life savings amount of money into the stock. Don't be disappointed if you hold for 2 days and aren't getting the gains you expected. The story is in the unfolding stage. If the stock drops back down to 75 today, there is always tomorrow and the next day and the next. The stock no doubt is steadily going up regardless of the crazy intraday prices.
* Imagine your wife's boyfriend stopped right before the climax. Imagine the look on your wife's face when she realized her BF pulled out early. Don't let that be you. 
* BECOME THE WIFE'S BOYFRIEND. BUY GME. POUND THE SHORTS INTO GRAINY DUST",gkv4nul,1611721492,1/26/2021 21:24

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. **What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share.** And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically **the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up.** This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. **Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you.** Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.

Select GME > Trade > Sell > Dollars Tab top right > Limit Order > Set to $1000, Continue > Extended Hours > Good till cancelled > Pick number of shares > Send it

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

GME,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

GME,"An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no.

GME,"THINGS U CAN DO TO HELP THE SQUEEZE

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

GME,"To tie up all available shares:  Set active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. Set the good till date good till cancel. Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

As some of you might know, there is a sub which is basically a german WSB ( r/Mauerstrassenwetten ). 

In this sub, the GME hype is just as real as it is here. 
Everyday at 7:30 CET, we buy whatever we can buy. We Hold, we hold as if our lives were to depend on it, and we try to keep the stock as high as possible, until the reinforcement which has the *actual* buying power, comes in at 15:30 CET, or rather 9:30 EST. 

You are the reinforcement. 

You are the buying power. 

You are the allies, this time with the germans on your side, and a mission to accomplish. 

We count on you to buy and hold, we believe in you to buy and hold, and we depend on you to buy and hold. 

*Together*! We can crush the market manipulating, shorting cunts at melvin, shitron and all the other shitshows. 

This is not just a thing between americans. I have seen people from sweden, the netherlands, spain poland and countless other european nations on this sub, salivating to the thought of crushing GME‚Äòs enemys.

Little do they know is I'm all in.  I eat crayons, stick my finger in electrical sockets, and lick windows.  This is our time.  We buy every dip they throw at us with our 2.3583 shares in our dinky Robinhood accounts.

GME,"That was a margin call
The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

Seeing that slimy fuck Andrew Left gasp his way into bullshit reasons on shorting GME reminded me of how those assholes stopped the amazing momentum both NIO and PLTR had. NIO and PLTR were my babies that I had invested long before WSB picked up.

GME,"That was a margin call The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

COPY AND PASTE ON WORD OR WHATEVER, READ!!! 

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",gl6r3cd,1611919237,1/29/2021 4:20

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

GME,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

Now as we prepare to pen our names in the history books with the ink of Melvin‚Äôs tears, please consider why you‚Äôre here.

Are you here to flex your papyrus metacarpi with a measely +911% return, only for Melvin to ride out of this to short another day?

Are you here to bow down to Citadel and prove to them that they still have total control over our market?

Are you here to make a few bucks to allow your wife‚Äôs boyfriend to get his asshole bleached?

We can't be consumed by our petty individual losses anymore.

We will be united in our common interest. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Perhaps its fate that today is the day chicken tenders were invented, and you will once again be fighting for your tendies, not from tyranny, persecution, or annihilation -- but from oppression.

GME,"An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop",gkwl5ew,1611745538,1/27/2021 4:05

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. ‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. ‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. ‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. ‚Å†What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)

6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

GME,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

GME,"I love how awkward player videos are for these stat segments.

GME,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö",glbjia9,1612000347,1/30/2021 2:52

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",gl8yd16,1611963881,1/29/2021 16:44

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD
Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",gldjm2t,1612050280,1/30/2021 16:44

GME,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect with $AMC this week:

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	‚Å†BUY
2.	‚Å†HOLD
3.	‚Å†BUY MORE
4.	‚Å†HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. ‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. ‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. ‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.

6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

GME,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glq8smm,1612302371,2/2/2021 14:46

GME,"/u/Unlucky-Prize, you've had some of the best written and most thorough DD on this thing the whole way through, even from the opposite side. Way better arguments presented than Citron had.

1 of 2 things will happen now. 

1. Like you said, Bears finally start cutting their losses before further bleeding, or...

2. You have magical inverse factors, and GME collapses right as you close your put positions, taking all of us with you. You believe up, it goes down. You believe down, it goes up. We start an inverse Unlucky-Prize fund and cut you a cool 25% and we all retire the richest autists to date before 2022.

GME,"I was actually more in agreement with the conclusions in your previous posts than this one. My theory: This is showing more hallmarks of Blue Apron squeeze than a short squeeze.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.

**Long term**

* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B. But that will take time, patience and legit üíéüëê that most don't have.

I can see ways in this can go very badly if some big dick hedge fund manager decides its time to swing. How much will retail endure if they take -50% in one day ? Not everyone here is DFV and there are a lot of late joiners.

But overall, the buying pressure has been so relentless that without a serious shock, I don't see a trend reversal soon.  I don't even think the 100M USD offer from GME they have pre-approved would quench the thirst.

if not much but shorts calmly covering over the next two weeks happens, that still takes us from 117 to 69 M shares, which is a GME at 110 and change.  ( if they haven't started covering yet)",gkl44sp,1611531402,1/24/2021 16:36

GME,"Friendly reminders

* The market doesn't care what your entry price is. You may have bought in at 1, or bought in at 156 yesterday. The market doesn't care. Short term we are going to see more erratic behavior. If your conviction entering this trade is that eventually GME will moon and the shorts are getting their nuts squeezed off, WHO CARES what the current stock price is. You know the outcome. Stick to your guns so you can see this thing through. Don't sell then jump back in then sell. Buy in heavy and hold, increase your position during the dips to get lower resistance to the stock. Don't sell, a lot of OTM calls are expiring on Friday. The best is yet to come. 
* Most of us in here are not day traders. You're kidding yourself if you think you can ""time the wave"" just right and sell at the high, then buy back in at the low. Even professional traders don't know what they are doing half the time.
* You only get hurt if you jump off a rollercoaster. In this case, imagine how screwed you will be if you jump off a rocket ship as it's accelerating into space.
* Lastly, don't stay up at night imaging what could have been. Who cares that you didn't notice the story until a few days ago, or that you didn't buy more at this time or sell at that time. You're in for the ride now. No one knows where exactly this will go, but 99.9 percent of us know it's going up considering almost everyone in here is doing yolo life savings amount of money into the stock. Don't be disappointed if you hold for 2 days and aren't getting the gains you expected. The story is in the unfolding stage. If the stock drops back down to 75 today, there is always tomorrow and the next day and the next. The stock no doubt is steadily going up regardless of the crazy intraday prices.
* Imagine your wife's boyfriend stopped right before the climax. Imagine the look on your wife's face when she realized her BF pulled out early. Don't let that be you. 
* BECOME THE WIFE'S BOYFRIEND. BUY GME. POUND THE SHORTS INTO GRAINY DUST",gkv4nul,1611721492,1/26/2021 21:24

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. **What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share.** And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically **the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up.** This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. **Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you.** Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.

in Robinhood:

Select GME > Trade > Sell > Dollars Tab top right > Limit Order > Set to $1000, Continue > Extended Hours > Good till cancelled > Pick number of shares > Send it

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

GME,"Fuck these Wall Street fucks....the middle class constantly complains about the fat cats on Wall St. and the rich elitists. Welp, now is your golden opportunity as a commoner and middle class person to rip off their heads and shit down their throats. 

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no. If all I need to do is buy gme to stick it to these fucks then so be it. Buying 500 shares today.",gktdljc,1611691697,1/26/2021 13:08

GME,"THINGS U CAN DO TO HELP THE SQUEEZE

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

Which ultimately backfired because they now lost $4 Billion and diamond hands went up +20% for the day.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

GME,"To tie up all available shares:  Set active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. Set the good till date good till cancel. Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

GME,"**Read 
I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

For Corporate America, I offer you this DD.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but üçåüçåüçå for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

GME,"Good morning, retards.

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.

Edit:  Woah.  My first gold!  Thank you, ape.  I have no idea what to do with gold, but I appreciate it.  Wish I could put it towards GME.

Edit 2:  wtf is happening?  Another gold?  Thank you!  I wrote this after watching that smug bastard on CNBC try to claim we were doing something illegal.  It pissed me off, so I had to say something.  


Edit 3:  I'm...don't...just...wow.  Thank you all!  The feedback on this illustrates that I'm not alone in my thinking, and I find that incredibly comforting.

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

GME,"Can I just take a moment to say that above learned more about the actual stock market since January than I have in the entire preceding year. As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh. 


Edit: sorry for the above, my 3 year old grabbed my phone and just started typing.

TODAY, for the first time since I opened my account, I'm at a profit. Of $100. On GME. I made an extra $100 on the money I initially invested.

To bigger apes, this is nothing. It's pocket change. But to me, it's a revelation. It's a sign that, if I play my cards right, I *might* be able to afford a house in about 10 years.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",glq8smm,1612302371,2/2/2021 14:46

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

GME,"**GME has made me want to quit my job. And not because of tendies**   


But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy f\*ks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a f\*king WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even an r-word. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

They advised me to open a official complaint with Trading 212 by emailing them here: Compliance@trading212.co.uk

If you are unhappy with their reply you then escalate it to the FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN who then charges the company for processing a complaint.

0800 0234567 Financial ombudsman

If T212 hasn‚Äôt replied within 8 weeks you can go straight to the ombudsman!

I will create a draft email in which you may copy.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i‚Äôm sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the meantime honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‚Äòlooking out‚Äô for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don‚Äôt believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK

GME,"*Copy and paste this in the daily threads and save your own personal copy in case WSB goes dark again.*

# Friday, Jan 29 is NOT the sell date for GME.

Recently I have started to see a lot of posts and comments hinting at a Friday sell-off because that is when the squeeze is going to happen. **THIS IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!**

The reason why Friday was initially brought up, to begin with, is because every OTM GME call that was written by MMs a couple of weeks ago are now ITM. This means by Friday close, any MM that did not properly hedge their GME position will be a victim to a Gamma squeeze in which millions of GME shares will have to be bought in order to fill out the call orders as they get exercised. This will **potentially** trigger the short squeeze as millions of shares are bought in quick succession forcing the price upwards in an even more parabolic manner.

If the short squeeze does not happen on Friday, then next week will just be a repeat of this week. More retail buying, more CNBC fear-mongering, and more GME calls becoming ITM.

# Fundamentally, there is NO difference between this Friday and any other Friday

Also, on another note, when the short squeeze does happen, keep these facts in mind:

# Short Squeezes are NOT quick events. Shorters can take days or even WEEKS to cover their positions.

I have also noticed that some people are starting to get the idea that the squeeze will be quick and be done.  **THIS IS FALSE.**

The duration of a short squeeze is measured by the Days To Cover Ratio **(Total Short Float / Average Daily Trading Volume).**

Right now, the DTC is at 6 days on MarketBeat and the short float is at 121% as of this morning [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

DTC data at shortsqueeze is more recent. It has DTC at 2.5days. 

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME)

Find short float data here:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Feel free to send me more links so I can post it here and make adjustments.

**When can you tell a short squeeze is happening?**

Pay very close attention to the short float as per the total number of shares outstanding. When the short float starts to go down drastically, it means the rocket ship just hit 0 Gs and we are now bound for infinity and beyond!

**What is the price target?**

No one knows but unlike the squeeze of Volkswagon, where the institutions reached an agreement with the company board, there is **NO WAY** hedge funds can make an agreement with us retail investors (*because we are not a singular entity and anyone that says otherwise is either ignorant or pushing a false narrative*) so the price is whatever we want it to be. Either way, that $1,000 price target is starting to look **REALLY** cheap right now so in my opinion, you might want to add a zero to that.

Happy hunting.",gl3457m,1611870146,1/28/2021 14:42
GME,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

AND STOP THINKING THE SQUEEZE WILL NE FRODAY. THERES NO SET TIME FOR IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS WE HAVE CONTROL FOR HOW FAR IT GOES. 

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

GME," 

I hate to have to repost this however we need to spread AWARENESS on the issue of Market Manipulation and the current events. No, I AM NOT A BOT. I am a real person that lives in a cold dark room with my dog and I haven't showered in 5 weeks. I'm kidding! but I am Canadian. I am also in college so i don't have the fucking time to respond differently to every post. IM SORRY. But you all need to know this information.

GME IS NOT OVER! They are turning the average AUTIST into smooth brains!! This is true that bots have taken over WSB. This is true that bots with many awards bought by the hedge funds have taken over. WE MUST STAND TOGETHER. THIS VIDEO WILL EXPLAIN ALL YOUR DOUBTS!! üíéüôåüíé

In the following weeks, GME has plummeted. I will not deny that this week has been rough for everyone, including myself. The price had the appearance of everyone selling however my belief is that **phantom shares** are being brought into the market which in turn are being sold for less hence driving the price lower. To all the paper hand bitches; they also contributed a bit to the price being driven down. Now, I have linked a video that goes into thorough detail on why this is not over. It's not just showing graphs and discussing the trends, it goes over ALL THE EVENTS that have happened and the EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE '**SQUOOZE** of the **SQUEEZE'**. The HEDGE FUNDS are trying to scare us into selling. THESE BOTS are trying to make us sell. THESE ACCOUNTS(BOTS) can be BOUGHT and to manipulate US! FOR SOME, it is WORKING! Some of these accounts have so many awards blah blah blah, but none of them are OG WSB members!

Also, search up on youtube: **GROW TO ATTAIN**, the latest video on phantom shares will clear up everything for you and what to expect. So far, this is all in our favor if we keep holding or buying shares!

ALSO, look AT THAT LINK I POSTED, IT WILL CLEAR UP MANY THINGS FOR YOU! ALL POSITIVES FOR HOLD GANG, 400 GANG, 300 GANG, 200, 100, 5 GANG.

Also to all the new WSB members, welcome! Some of these posts are TOXIC, though WSB's goal HAS NOT CHANGED; AUTISTS/APES are taking that rocket ship and shoving it into Uranus. This means, if you want in the action, you must decide to get your ticket. Just make sure you don't put your money for College/University (I wonder what happened to that guy/girl) or life savings, this is a very volatile stock. Just know that you either are a paper handed bitch, or a diamond hand BAMF. üíéüôåüíé Once this rocket leaves the lithosphere, we ain't coming back to pick up the stragglers. So GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL HOLDING! APES STAND TOGETHER AND WE SHALL PREVAIL! Also, FEB 9th is coming up, IMPORTANT DAY! Mark it on your calendars! Check out this video for the reason why it's important, plus an explanation on why we have NOT lost the war! THE BATTLE THIS WEEK, WE LOST, HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T WON THE WAR!

Also, rest up, hydrate, and be prepared for the weeks to come. We shall have our movie, with a happy ending!

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you what to do with your money. I'm just an APE who likes this stock!! üíéüôåüíé

I would also post the to the WSB Forum, however, my karma level is too low/they won't allow me to post for some reason, I would post it there too if I could. I can‚Äôt even make a post on this forum either!

I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT KARMA POINTS, IF YOU CAN POST THIS ON WSB AND IT BLOWS UP IDGAF. JUST SPREAD THE WORD TO OTHERS AND THE ""RIGHT"" INFORMATION!",gmb0giu,1612686907,2/7/2021 1:35

GME,"spread the word 

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

\-Yesterday Gamestop CFO resigned, which is excellent news because he's part of the old guard that almost let Gamestop fade into non-existence. New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!

There's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now

The delta value is sitting at .6 when they do this, so they hedge these calls and buy 60 shares  around the $40 market price for each call they sold at $60 strike. As the price goes closer to $60, delta gets closer to 1 so they buy more shares at prices lower than $60 so they don‚Äôt lose their ass. As more MMs buy to cover their hedge, momentum picks up, buying intensifies and now you‚Äôre in a gamma squeeze where you have a ton of MMs buying to hedge their positions.

GME,"Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of üíéüñê who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. üíéüñê need to understand this and help all the üßªüñê retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",gol32rg,1614206085,2/24/2021 15:34

**THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SQUEEZE YET, PATIENCE AND DIAMOND HANDS REQUIRED**

The price shot up massively yesterday, true. But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.

But I think its essential to remember this

**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**

In a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.

**This is NOT what is happening now.**
The price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down 

**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**

UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.

**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**

Dont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.  But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.

GME,"Brokerages are still ""choosing"" what limit orders are allowed.

&#x200B;

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn‚Äôt just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

GME,"Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!!#

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

FOR SEC: EVERYTHING I AM SAYING IS AN ACCOUNT PURELY OF FICTION. ANY PERCEIVED SUGGESTIONS, DEMANDS, OR STOCK TRADING ADVICE IS PURELY A FANTASTIC EXERCISE WITH NO BASIS IN REALITY. THIS IS NOT AN STOCK INVESTMENT BOARD, IT IS FULL OF MEMES AND COMEDY/PARODY ACCOUNTS.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO üíé ü§≤ AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD
Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",gldjm2t,1612050280,1/30/2021 16:44

GME,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but üçåüçåüçå for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

GME,"Good morning, retards.

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

Those of us who are investors in GME aren't making comments like,  "" Look how much it dropped its so unfair""

 **The real investors,**  remember the previous GME squeeze and we know what happened was a desperate attempt by shorts to flood the market with short shares to drop the price.  This is actually, a good sign.  We have all seen this before. On January 27th.  

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

 Do one of these things or both.

1. Do not sell.
2. Buy

As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving

It's a new day though, we should see a bump at pre market again and Tuesdays are usually big days if we get some momentum going analysts are predicting we could close the day around 16 or 17. The problem was the volume and not enough diamond hands! People either getting afraid and selling off or just taking profits, we need to really hold! Tomorrow will be a better day. The hedges are trying to drive the price down as low as they can and start closing because they really don't want a repeat of GME so let's all buy more if we can and hold! We only get were we need to be by holding! The next 2 days are going to be pivotal for AMC! If we can break the 16 barrier and stay above it preferably finish above it its a great sign.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy f\*ks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a f\*king WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even an r-word. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

For those who want some excellent DD, here's a quick selection

They advised me to open a official complaint with Trading 212 by emailing them here: Compliance@trading212.co.uk

If you are unhappy with their reply you then escalate it to the FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN who then charges the company for processing a complaint.

0800 0234567 Financial ombudsman

If T212 hasn‚Äôt replied within 8 weeks you can go straight to the ombudsman!

I will create a draft email in which you may copy.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i‚Äôm sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the meantime honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‚Äòlooking out‚Äô for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don‚Äôt believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

GME,"*Copy and paste this in the daily threads and save your own personal copy in case WSB goes dark again.*

# Friday, Jan 29 is NOT the sell date for GME.

Recently I have started to see a lot of posts and comments hinting at a Friday sell-off because that is when the squeeze is going to happen. **THIS IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!**

The reason why Friday was initially brought up, to begin with, is because every OTM GME call that was written by MMs a couple of weeks ago are now ITM. This means by Friday close, any MM that did not properly hedge their GME position will be a victim to a Gamma squeeze in which millions of GME shares will have to be bought in order to fill out the call orders as they get exercised. This will **potentially** trigger the short squeeze as millions of shares are bought in quick succession forcing the price upwards in an even more parabolic manner.

If the short squeeze does not happen on Friday, then next week will just be a repeat of this week. More retail buying, more CNBC fear-mongering, and more GME calls becoming ITM.

# Fundamentally, there is NO difference between this Friday and any other Friday

Also, on another note, when the short squeeze does happen, keep these facts in mind:

# Short Squeezes are NOT quick events. Shorters can take days or even WEEKS to cover their positions.

I have also noticed that some people are starting to get the idea that the squeeze will be quick and be done.  **THIS IS FALSE.**

The duration of a short squeeze is measured by the Days To Cover Ratio **(Total Short Float / Average Daily Trading Volume).**

Right now, the DTC is at 6 days on MarketBeat and the short float is at 121% as of this morning [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

DTC data at shortsqueeze is more recent. It has DTC at 2.5days. 

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME)

Find short float data here:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Feel free to send me more links so I can post it here and make adjustments.

**When can you tell a short squeeze is happening?**

Pay very close attention to the short float as per the total number of shares outstanding. When the short float starts to go down drastically, it means the rocket ship just hit 0 Gs and we are now bound for infinity and beyond!

**What is the price target?**

No one knows but unlike the squeeze of Volkswagon, where the institutions reached an agreement with the company board, there is **NO WAY** hedge funds can make an agreement with us retail investors (*because we are not a singular entity and anyone that says otherwise is either ignorant or pushing a false narrative*) so the price is whatever we want it to be. Either way, that $1,000 price target is starting to look **REALLY** cheap right now so in my opinion, you might want to add a zero to that.

Happy hunting.",gl3457m,1611870146,1/28/2021 14:42
GME,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

AND STOP THINKING THE SQUEEZE WILL NE FRODAY. THERES NO SET TIME FOR IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS WE HAVE CONTROL FOR HOW FAR IT GOES. 

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

GME,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö

FWIW around that time, I scalped this for a nice gain too.

Funny, I scalped this...from 9.60 to 9.80 - because it stalled out around then and thought it was losing steam. Whoops. A gain's a gain.

It appears that what it's doing is looking for a significant change in volume, but does not account for the price change.  What you *really* want to be looking for is a significant change in volume with very little price change - that's what happened with KODK clearly due to insider trading.

Yea, this didn't bode too well. :/

&#x200B;

* Team RKT

Scalped that shit for a nice gain but not surprised a lot of guys held too long and got burned.

&#x200B;

* SNAP puts

\*sigh\* Lost something like $8k trying to put AFTER that one ER they mooned. They mooned 20% immediately and ended the day something like up 38%. Rekt my shit. 

&#x200B;

* Metals gang (SLV Surfers)

Tried GLD for a day - no thanks.

&#x200B;

* MGM

FWIW around that time, I scalped this for a nice gain too.

&#x200B;

* KODK bagholders anonymous

Funny, I scalped this...from 9.60 to 9.80 - because it stalled out around then and thought it was losing steam. Whoops. A gain's a gain.

&#x200B;

* DKNG DKNG DKNG DKNG

Doubled from yesterday to today on DKNG run up - but lost a bunch mistiming their inevitable bounce so bleh.

&#x200B;

* VBIV dude (he'd be happy now if he wasn't banned)

Fuck him even if he's right - he was annoying as shit.

&#x200B;

* The many fallen in service of TSLA gang on the uppies and downies

Yea tried timing their bounce back and mistimed. Oh well.

&#x200B;

* ZM puts

Now THIS one I really kept warning everyone about for a solid month or so and dudes weren't listening. It's a rare situation where a company basically becomes a household name overnight. Trying to bet against that as it's happening was just foolish.",g1dvihr,1597390586,8/14/2020 1:36
