Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",1/29/2021 16:44,BB

6147,6147,dp7qcxe,1509608334,"**Game 7 in the last decade** 

**2016** - Never was there a higher-stakes Game 7. The Cubs held the longest championship drought in the National League, at 108 years. The Indians held the longest in the American League, at 68 years. The Cubs, in their first World Series since the Second World War, had rallied from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7. The Indians, meanwhile, had lost a heartbreaking Game 7 in 1997, two short years after they had come up just short in 1995. The third try, they hoped, would pay for all. 

Kluber pitched for Cleveland on three day's rest, and almost immediately gave up a lead-off home run to Dexter Fowler. In the bottom of the third, the Indians tied the game on an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the tie was immediately broken by the Cubs in the top of the fourth with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Bryant ran aggressively on the shallow fly, sliding under the ga) and a double by Contreras. Kluber was knocked out an inning later on a Baez homer. Andrew Miller, exhausted from his heavy use that postseason, showed some signs of humanity, giving up a walk and an RBI single (again, Bryant's aggressive baserunning paid off, as he scored from first). 

The Indians knocked out Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth, when he issued a two-out walk. Jon Lester came out in relief, but David Ross committed a throwing error to put runners on second and third. A wild pitch ricocheted of his helmet and allowed two runs to score, narrowing the lead to 5-3. Ross atoned somewhat with a solo shot in the sixth, making the score 6-3.

There the score stood in the 8th inning when Rajai Davis stepped up to bat for Cleveland. Lester had gotten the first two outs, but a single by Jose Ramirez prompted Joe Maddon to bring in Chapman. Chapman, also exhausted, gave up an RBI double to Brandon Guyer, cutting the lead to 6-4. In eleven years, Davis had 55 career home runs. 

That night, he added another, hitting the latest game-tying home run in World Series history. Progressive Field exploded as he rounded the bases. It was the bottom of the 8th inning and Game 7 was *tied*. Both teams held out through the 9th, and Game 7, as it was always going to (it seemed in retrospect) entered extra innings. 

A sudden cloudburst halted play for 17 minutes. The thousands of fans and millions of spectators in their homes waited in nervous tension. Meanwhile, the players descended into their clubhouses, where Jason Heyward reportedly rallied the Cubs.  ""We're the best team in baseball. . . for a reason. . . Stick together and we're going to win this game."" 

In the top of the tenth, they proved Heyward right. Schwarber singled and was replaced by Alberto Almora. Bryant hit a deep fly and Almora tagged, dashing to second. Rizzo was intentionally walked to reach Ben Zobrist - who ripped an RBI double into left field, breaking the tie. Miguel Montero singled home Rizzo, and the Cubs had an 8-6 lead. 

The Indians would not go down without a fight. With two outs, Brandon Guyer reached on a walk, then dashed to second with Davis once again at the plate. Davis couldn't repeat the home run, but he could and did single Guyer home. Game 7 was once again a 1-run game. Michael Montgomery came into face Michael Martinez.

Martinez swung, bounced the ball towards Bryant - and Bryant, with a smile as wide as Christmas on his face, charged in, scooped up the ball, and fired to first base. Three outs. Final score, 8-7, Cubs. For the first time since the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, the Chicago Cubs had won the World Series.

**2014** - Even year magic's final showdown against whatever devil magic the Royals had somehow come up with that wild October. The Royals had dominated the Giants in Game 6, 10-0, and were playing Game 7, at home. The last 9 home teams to force Game 7 had all gone on to win. Everything seemed to favor the Royals. 

Except, perhaps, for Madison Bumgarner. 

Jeremie Guthrie gave up two runs in the top of the second, giving up 3 straight singles to load the bases, then 2 sacrifice flies. Kansas City struck back in the bottom half, as an Alex Gordon double somehow scored the lumbering Billy Butler from first base. Gordon advanced to third on a groundout, then tied the game on a sac fly. The game looked set to go back and forth, and as the innings went on, the bullpen advantage would increasingly tip the advantage to KC. 

But then, in the fourth, the Giants scratched across a third run. A broken-bat single scored Sandoval from third, and the Giants had a 3-2 lead. No matter - the Royals had overcome a 4-run deficit in the Wild Card. The same team, less than a year later, would come back no less than 8 separate times in the postseason, including every World Series game they won. 

But when the bottom half of the fourth came, the Giants bullpen door opened - and out stepped Madison Bumgarner. 

It was only two days of rest. He had just pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5. No matter. His team had entrusted him with a 1-run lead in Game 7 of the World Series, and he would defend it. MadBum gave up a single to Infante, then settled in and retired the next 14 Royals in a row. 

The KC bullpen kept the game scoreless, and tension mounted in Kauffman as the innings drew on. Inning by inning, out by out, pitch by pitch the Giants' ace labored. Sweat poured off his face. He was breathing hard with exertion, as his total pitch count for the World Series reached 250 and continued to climb. But he did not yield. 

At last, in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, a breakthrough. Gordon singled - and then the Giants' outfield misplayed the ball. The Royals outfielder had not been running hard to first, but when he saw the error he dug hard and scorched into third. The stadium crowd started to roar. Did KC have one last miracle comeback in them? At the plate was Salvador Perez, the only man who had scored off Madbum in the World Series. If he could do the same here, he woudl win the game and the Series in one swing of the bat. 

Well, we all know what happened. Bumgarner threw nothing but fastballs, high and inside. Salvy couldn't help himself but swing. He fell behind in the count, fought off one pitch, offered at another - and popped it foul to Sandoval, in foul territory, for the third out. The Giants sealed even year magic and won their 3rd championship in 5 years. Madison Bumgarner was rightly proclaimed the MVP. 

**2011** - After the wild ride that was Game 6, it seemed inevitable that Game 7 would disappoint. At first, though, it looked to be yet another shootout between the Rangers and the Cardinals. Chris Carpenter  - making his third start that Series - yielded two RBI doubles in the first inning, making the score 2-0 Texas. 

Unfortunately for the Rangers, those were the last two runs they have scored in the World Series to date.

David Freese (who else) tied the game in the bottom of the first with a 2-run double, then in the third Allen Craig hit the go-ahead homer. Without a hit in the fifth inning, the Cardinals piled two more runs on. Yadi walked with the bases loaded, then C. J. Wilson relieved Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch. To complete the dissolution of the Rangers, Craig robbed a home run from Nelson Cruz in the sixth. In the seventh, Berkmann singled home another run for St. Louis to make it 6-2 Cardinals. 

Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.",11/2/2017 1:38,BB

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren‚Äôt really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
‚ÄúWell, this is too expensive!‚Äù, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  ‚ÄúI simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.‚Äù
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
‚ÄúExcuse me, good sir? Don‚Äôt you want to buy this game? It‚Äôs all the rage!‚Äù He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he‚Äôd only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn‚Äôt too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When‚Äôs the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn‚Äôt happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn‚Äôt worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn‚Äôt owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn‚Äôt count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn‚Äôt worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that‚Äôs when he realized. It‚Äôs not about the game. It‚Äôs about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",1/27/2021 7:39,BB

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

But you know who was always there for me when I needed another controller because my friends were coming over after school and I wanted us to 4 way split screen some Halo 3 on the 15 year old tube TV upstairs? Gamestop.

Who started expanding their inventory in the last few years to include more stuff from other hobbies I enjoy like Gundam model kits and board games? Gamestop.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",1/29/2021 4:20,BB

Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that weren‚Äôt really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
‚ÄúWell, this is too expensive!‚Äù, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  ‚ÄúI simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.‚Äù
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
‚ÄúExcuse me, good sir? Don‚Äôt you want to buy this game? It‚Äôs all the rage!‚Äù He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and he‚Äôd only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasn‚Äôt too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. When‚Äôs the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didn‚Äôt happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasn‚Äôt worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldn‚Äôt owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didn‚Äôt count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasn‚Äôt worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And that‚Äôs when he realized. It‚Äôs not about the game. It‚Äôs about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",1/27/2021 7:39,BB

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

21983,21983,gl1ov2q,1611835441,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",1/29/2021 4:20,BB

24721,24721,gl1ov2q,1611835441,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

32329,32329,dp7qcxe,1509608334,"**Game 7 in the last decade** 

**2016** - Never was there a higher-stakes Game 7. The Cubs held the longest championship drought in the National League, at 108 years. The Indians held the longest in the American League, at 68 years. The Cubs, in their first World Series since the Second World War, had rallied from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7. The Indians, meanwhile, had lost a heartbreaking Game 7 in 1997, two short years after they had come up just short in 1995. The third try, they hoped, would pay for all. 

Kluber pitched for Cleveland on three day's rest, and almost immediately gave up a lead-off home run to Dexter Fowler. In the bottom of the third, the Indians tied the game on an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the tie was immediately broken by the Cubs in the top of the fourth with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Bryant ran aggressively on the shallow fly, sliding under the ga) and a double by Contreras. Kluber was knocked out an inning later on a Baez homer. Andrew Miller, exhausted from his heavy use that postseason, showed some signs of humanity, giving up a walk and an RBI single (again, Bryant's aggressive baserunning paid off, as he scored from first). 

The Indians knocked out Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth, when he issued a two-out walk. Jon Lester came out in relief, but David Ross committed a throwing error to put runners on second and third. A wild pitch ricocheted of his helmet and allowed two runs to score, narrowing the lead to 5-3. Ross atoned somewhat with a solo shot in the sixth, making the score 6-3.

There the score stood in the 8th inning when Rajai Davis stepped up to bat for Cleveland. Lester had gotten the first two outs, but a single by Jose Ramirez prompted Joe Maddon to bring in Chapman. Chapman, also exhausted, gave up an RBI double to Brandon Guyer, cutting the lead to 6-4. In eleven years, Davis had 55 career home runs. 

That night, he added another, hitting the latest game-tying home run in World Series history. Progressive Field exploded as he rounded the bases. It was the bottom of the 8th inning and Game 7 was *tied*. Both teams held out through the 9th, and Game 7, as it was always going to (it seemed in retrospect) entered extra innings. 

A sudden cloudburst halted play for 17 minutes. The thousands of fans and millions of spectators in their homes waited in nervous tension. Meanwhile, the players descended into their clubhouses, where Jason Heyward reportedly rallied the Cubs.  ""We're the best team in baseball. . . for a reason. . . Stick together and we're going to win this game."" 

In the top of the tenth, they proved Heyward right. Schwarber singled and was replaced by Alberto Almora. Bryant hit a deep fly and Almora tagged, dashing to second. Rizzo was intentionally walked to reach Ben Zobrist - who ripped an RBI double into left field, breaking the tie. Miguel Montero singled home Rizzo, and the Cubs had an 8-6 lead. 

The Indians would not go down without a fight. With two outs, Brandon Guyer reached on a walk, then dashed to second with Davis once again at the plate. Davis couldn't repeat the home run, but he could and did single Guyer home. Game 7 was once again a 1-run game. Michael Montgomery came into face Michael Martinez.

Martinez swung, bounced the ball towards Bryant - and Bryant, with a smile as wide as Christmas on his face, charged in, scooped up the ball, and fired to first base. Three outs. Final score, 8-7, Cubs. For the first time since the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, the Chicago Cubs had won the World Series.

**2014** - Even year magic's final showdown against whatever devil magic the Royals had somehow come up with that wild October. The Royals had dominated the Giants in Game 6, 10-0, and were playing Game 7, at home. The last 9 home teams to force Game 7 had all gone on to win. Everything seemed to favor the Royals. 

Except, perhaps, for Madison Bumgarner. 

Jeremie Guthrie gave up two runs in the top of the second, giving up 3 straight singles to load the bases, then 2 sacrifice flies. Kansas City struck back in the bottom half, as an Alex Gordon double somehow scored the lumbering Billy Butler from first base. Gordon advanced to third on a groundout, then tied the game on a sac fly. The game looked set to go back and forth, and as the innings went on, the bullpen advantage would increasingly tip the advantage to KC. 

But then, in the fourth, the Giants scratched across a third run. A broken-bat single scored Sandoval from third, and the Giants had a 3-2 lead. No matter - the Royals had overcome a 4-run deficit in the Wild Card. The same team, less than a year later, would come back no less than 8 separate times in the postseason, including every World Series game they won. 

But when the bottom half of the fourth came, the Giants bullpen door opened - and out stepped Madison Bumgarner. 

It was only two days of rest. He had just pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5. No matter. His team had entrusted him with a 1-run lead in Game 7 of the World Series, and he would defend it. MadBum gave up a single to Infante, then settled in and retired the next 14 Royals in a row. 

The KC bullpen kept the game scoreless, and tension mounted in Kauffman as the innings drew on. Inning by inning, out by out, pitch by pitch the Giants' ace labored. Sweat poured off his face. He was breathing hard with exertion, as his total pitch count for the World Series reached 250 and continued to climb. But he did not yield. 

At last, in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, a breakthrough. Gordon singled - and then the Giants' outfield misplayed the ball. The Royals outfielder had not been running hard to first, but when he saw the error he dug hard and scorched into third. The stadium crowd started to roar. Did KC have one last miracle comeback in them? At the plate was Salvador Perez, the only man who had scored off Madbum in the World Series. If he could do the same here, he woudl win the game and the Series in one swing of the bat. 

Well, we all know what happened. Bumgarner threw nothing but fastballs, high and inside. Salvy couldn't help himself but swing. He fell behind in the count, fought off one pitch, offered at another - and popped it foul to Sandoval, in foul territory, for the third out. The Giants sealed even year magic and won their 3rd championship in 5 years. Madison Bumgarner was rightly proclaimed the MVP. 

**2011** - After the wild ride that was Game 6, it seemed inevitable that Game 7 would disappoint. At first, though, it looked to be yet another shootout between the Rangers and the Cardinals. Chris Carpenter  - making his third start that Series - yielded two RBI doubles in the first inning, making the score 2-0 Texas. 

Unfortunately for the Rangers, those were the last two runs they have scored in the World Series to date.

David Freese (who else) tied the game in the bottom of the first with a 2-run double, then in the third Allen Craig hit the go-ahead homer. Without a hit in the fifth inning, the Cardinals piled two more runs on. Yadi walked with the bases loaded, then C. J. Wilson relieved Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch. To complete the dissolution of the Rangers, Craig robbed a home run from Nelson Cruz in the sixth. In the seventh, Berkmann singled home another run for St. Louis to make it 6-2 Cardinals. 

Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.",11/2/2017 1:38,BB

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Don't listen to anything I say. I'm not a financial advisor, I eat crayons and gather facts from a memes

As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh.
