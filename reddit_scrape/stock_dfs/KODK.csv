39384,39384,fzn08jr,1596071807,"SEC is just the governmentâ€™s front to do dirty business legally. When companies like TSLA start acting out of line or pisses off Daddy Trump, the government releases SEC to remind everyone who the top dog is. 

SEC will give zero shits about KODK since the company is being backed by Daddy Trump and his cash cow goons. Market is rigged.",7/29/2020 19:16,KODK
44612,44612,fzmwdp6,1596069874,Itâ€™s tuff you have to be uber fucken fast. Especially with a pump in dump scam that we all witnessed with KODK. You had seconds to react before it got sold off. With something like that you almost have to start selling well the price is going up. It topped at like 56$ to get all of it sold before the sell off you would of had to start selling at like 50$ and even then you have seconds to react. Itâ€™s not RH fault.,7/29/2020 18:44,KODK

44645,44645,fzp15ia,1596109729,"I was also in KODK and thought I unfairly lost $755. Bought 295 at $8. At open I was walking a stop-limit up behind to finish at SL of $20.95 when it was $21.35. Then it dropped to $19.50 and SL didnâ€™t trigger. I sat there hoping for software lag. Nope, you still have 295 shares. So I panicked, canceled SL, made new for $18.50 and it hit within seconds and I was out. Made $3k, felt like I lost $755 unfairly, and watched it climb to $50â€™s.  I did ask RH, blah blah about stop loss becomes market order, but must have buyer. I said it was stop limit and asked how can I tell itâ€™s still protecting me, and how far down will it go.  No answer.",7/30/2020 5:48,KODK
