421,421,go2lhyp,1613812996,"I‚Äôve only been investing since 2017. My first stock purchase was like 20 shares of MoviePass (RIP). I only invested like $10 and the shares split and went to a penny, I took my loss, that sucked. But then I bought other stocks, I bought a few shares of Ford, Energy Transfer because it paid a dividend. These were minuscule purchases with little to lose. 

During the crash at the end of 2018, I watched AAPL crash from $230 to $130ish, bought a few shares on the low, felt risky spending that much for a share. When it ballooned back up to $200 or so I sold some shares to take the profit, and bought back in. I later bought Microsoft, and a few others. 

I was just filing my taxes the other night and saw in 2020 I sold maybe 4 shares total of anything for a net zero profit. 

I‚Äôve learned that set and forget can be a good thing. Patience is key, and if you like the stock (sorry for the trendy phrase), buy more when you feel comfortable. 

I‚Äôve had friends join apps last year to try and make money day trading and witnessed them all take Ls. 

Ive fallen for the PnDs (Chesapeake Energy, AMC, GME) and came out with losses in all, but that‚Äôs because I took a chance to join what I thought was a movement, but I never put in more than I was willing to lose. 

To all new investors, do your due diligence, don‚Äôt invest in something you don‚Äôt believe in. Watch YouTube videos and read articles about the companies you are interested in before investing. Remember any time to take a profit, you will have to pay taxes on it. Lastly, don‚Äôt invest anything you aren‚Äôt willing to lose.

1093,1093,glqp3il,1612308989,"It is great that you started investing so young, it is the time for high risk/reward since you have time to recover after. It is good to take note of your reactions and behavious when things don't work out as expected. You may have thought you would react a certain way but then realize that you did not react the way you thought you would.

It is good to balance your risk and be realistic. **Trying to make money fast usually results in paying for being impatient**. Since high risk comes with high reward it means you only need to invest a little bit, on the off chance that it works out to your benefit. So you can have a big chunk of money in an ETF / Index fund / ect and then a small sliver for doing your own higher risk trades.

You have many years before retiring and it helps to put it in perspective. $25k over a lifetime is not that much, but use this as a lesson for yourself to grow and become a better investor. I am sure it already has you thinking more about your decisions and wanting to be more strategic. **That is progress already!**

1977,1977,go2lhyp,1613812996,"I‚Äôve only been investing since 2017. My first stock purchase was like 20 shares of MoviePass (RIP). I only invested like $10 and the shares split and went to a penny, I took my loss, that sucked. But then I bought other stocks, I bought a few shares of Ford, Energy Transfer because it paid a dividend. These were minuscule purchases with little to lose. 

During the crash at the end of 2018, I watched AAPL crash from $230 to $130ish, bought a few shares on the low, felt risky spending that much for a share. When it ballooned back up to $200 or so I sold some shares to take the profit, and bought back in. I later bought Microsoft, and a few others. 

I was just filing my taxes the other night and saw in 2020 I sold maybe 4 shares total of anything for a net zero profit. 

I‚Äôve learned that set and forget can be a good thing. Patience is key, and if you like the stock (sorry for the trendy phrase), buy more when you feel comfortable. 

I‚Äôve had friends join apps last year to try and make money day trading and witnessed them all take Ls. 

Ive fallen for the PnDs (Chesapeake Energy, AMC, GME) and came out with losses in all, but that‚Äôs because I took a chance to join what I thought was a movement, but I never put in more than I was willing to lose. 

To all new investors, do your due diligence, don‚Äôt invest in something you don‚Äôt believe in. Watch YouTube videos and read articles about the companies you are interested in before investing. Remember any time to take a profit, you will have to pay taxes on it. Lastly, don‚Äôt invest anything you aren‚Äôt willing to lose.

It is good to take note of your reactions and behavious when things don't work out as expected. You may have thought you would react a certain way but then realize that you did not react the way you thought you would.

It is good to balance your risk and be realistic. **Trying to make money fast usually results in paying for being impatient**. Since high risk comes with high reward it means you only need to invest a little bit, on the off chance that it works out to your benefit. So you can have a big chunk of money in an ETF / Index fund / ect and then a small sliver for doing your own higher risk trades.

You have many years before retiring and it helps to put it in perspective. $25k over a lifetime is not that much, but use this as a lesson for yourself to grow and become a better investor. I am sure it already has you thinking more about your decisions and wanting to be more strategic. **That is progress already!**

it seems like no matter the outcome it'll be a sell the news ER least they guide 2019 amazingly but that doesnt' seem like the case given how they had to get an early jump on warning revenue forecast.

If you plan on investing long-term, diversify your portfolio and get used to buying in at regular intervals, just like you'd deposit into your savings account. Volatility is part of the game but by investing regularly over time, you'll track the market up.

8 months ago was the start of an absolutely insane market rally, from the bottom of an absolutely insane market dip. Everyone who began investing there experienced ""easy mode"". Just pour money into stocks and ride the speculation wave up.

Going forward, consider diversifying, either into broader ETFs (your VWRA looks somewhat diverse, but it's also heavily tech-focused), or at least into blue-chip companies in other sectors outside of tech.

Not financial advice. Especially with COVID recovery, money is going to move around a lot more as entertainment industry begins to open. Will probably see a slowdown of tech as money moves into other industries.

If you have a higher risk tolerance this can be fine. However, if this dip is making you squirm you need to reassess. It's well within normal fluctuations. 

I'm not saying blindly sell but you should consider what the best path forward is. I'm down about 15% in the last week; for the same reason. I'm over concentrated (and leveraged) in AAPL specifically. However, I'm content to ride it out and using covered calls to mitigate the losses. 

You said, you've only been involved in the market for 8 months, market performance over that timeline is not 'normal'. The gains have been way above normal due to three factors. One, we came off the COVID crash (an over reaction). Two, massive stimulus inflating equity prices (this will end eventually).
