To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö",1/30/2021 2:52,GME

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They  didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî>  price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",1/29/2021 16:44,GME

It's a new day though, we should see a bump at pre market again and Tuesdays are usually big days if we get some momentum going analysts are predicting we could close the day around 16 or 17. The problem was the volume and not enough diamond hands! People either getting afraid and selling off or just taking profits, we need to really hold! Tomorrow will be a better day. The hedges are trying to drive the price down as low as they can and start closing because they really don't want a repeat of GME so let's all buy more if we can and hold!

This can give those, who do not want to get involved financially, to still support us, and we create a fund that will help us win this fight and spread the tendies around too.

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

2029,2029,glbjtm9,1612000501,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",1/30/2021 2:55,GME

I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

\-DFV told congress and the entire nation during the last hearing he still thinks GME is attractive at then-current price and outlined why(opportunity for pivot, once industry leaders in gaming, etc.).

\-They didn't believe him, so with steel balls a'swinging he doubled down and bought 50K more shares of GME

\-Yesterday Gamestop CFO resigned, which is excellent news because he's part of the old guard that almost let Gamestop fade into non-existence. New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!

They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of üíéüñê who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. üíéüñê need to understand this and help all the üßªüñê retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",2/24/2021 15:34,GME

**THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SQUEEZE YET, PATIENCE AND DIAMOND HANDS REQUIRED**

The price shot up massively yesterday, true. But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.

But I think its essential to remember this

**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**

In a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.

**This is NOT what is happening now.**
The price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down 

**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**

UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.

**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**

Dont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.

I devolved from ape form in order to be human and lose more money from these said stocks, when I could've just held on with my once diamond hands and added more funds to my account, instead of selling on a 60%/$1000 loss (not so much to the average person, but to a college student, quite a lot no?)

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

I am a poor motherfucker and I yolo'd everything I could spare. 150 dollars. Into GME. I borrowed another 70 from a friend just so I could get 2 at 110. And I honestly didn't care if it took off or not. I simply wanted to watch wall street sweat and be a part of the movement that shed light on the shady shit that goes on there. I was totally prepared to watch it ride to zero and just count it as the cost of revolution. So I've held this whole time. I considered averaging down at $43 but I really couldn't afford it if it tanked further so I didn't.

I was one of the late joining bag holders. It took me a while to get my fidelity account setup and ready I wanted in before Jan 27/28 but couldn't get my funds approved and transferred and settled before then. This is giving me hope again. Hope that I'll recoup my investment in addition to the exposure that came from this which was my real reason for getting into it. Yea I wanted to make some money too but, I'd never considered stocks before this. Thank you retards so much for all the posts these last weeks. I lurk here and read and rarely post.

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",1/25/2021 19:00,GME

5764,5764,gkqnfj0,1611631084,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

5787,5787,gkpd10p,1611609758,"If you've never bought stock before, this is all probably confusing. GameStop can't really be headed to $1,000/share, right?


Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

6618,6618,gl1e8pd,1611830370,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Who started expanding their inventory in the last few years to include more stuff from other hobbies I enjoy like Gundam model kits and board games? Gamestop.

If I woke up tomorrow, and all of us truly believed that GME was worth 10K then it would hit 10K easy. Nobody would be selling, and everyone would be buying in on this massive discount. It's about the psychology. Wall street is using scare tactics to try and make that belief waver. They want you to believe that GME might only be worth 1K, or 300, or 30 based on ""fundamentals."" They want you to think you're late to the party. They want you to think that we're all a bunch of cowards who are going to cash out on the first dip and crash the price.

I don't know when or how this ends and maybe I get burned at the end of the day holding the bag but we've raised awareness across the globe of the greed and flawed system. People are noticing. Not just normies like me and you, but wealthy individuals like Chamath, Elon and El Presidente Dave Portnoy and may others. Politicians like AOC are tweeting about it. 

This will all be worth it because they now know the power of the people and we won't back down to their scare tactics and rigging.

If they want to keep playing this game, we can play too (if we want). The choice is ours now. We gave up way too much power last year begging for $600 dollars after 8 months while they collected paychecks and laughed behind our backs.

But guess who is pretending not to notice? The suits that use this rigged system to take our money. The media personalities that are calling us stupid and market manipulators. We aren't manipulating anything. We are free independent investors that see truth from fiction.

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii‚Äôs were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

1) Friday may not be the day. Shorts DO NOT HAVE TO COVER. There is no expiration on those, unless the institution that lent them those shares demands that they cover.

2) Calls that expire Friday do NOT need to be covered by institutions until the next week Mon/Tues (they have 3 days). So even that massive open interest that's ITM may not spur huge movements until next week. Stay patient.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

‚ÄúFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue.

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn‚Äôt just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valh«´ll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valh«´ll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stocküíéüôå"" and you ascend to godhood.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO üíé ü§≤ AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70.

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so let‚Äôs start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it‚Äôs going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don‚Äôt want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

I‚Äôve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday‚Äôs... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. 


NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow. 

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently.

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

9214,9214,gkqq3m3,1611632261,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

To the paper hands selling, I strongly suggest you research ""Short Squeeze"" and also research whats happening with GME and similar. Big money buying puts (puts are a loan), they HAVE to buy the stock in the future. That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.

don‚Äôt know how a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze stays below 4-digits.
Here is some proof of this point ‚Äì it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.
Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let‚Äôs go back again to the available
float 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been
traded 5 times. There‚Äôs just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know
DFV didn‚Äôt sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didn‚Äôt get sold and bought 5
times. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.

>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer
shares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on
gamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to
cover their calls. But there weren‚Äôt enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to
close a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again. (The dips in volume on
the chart were the halts during trading)

Look for next week to potentially repeat this as Thursday and Friday, investors will probably pile into $115c 0DTE options and will cause a similar gamma squeeze.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

10149,10149,glmu9la,1612234711,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect with $AMC this week:

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	‚Å†BUY
2.	‚Å†HOLD
3.	‚Å†BUY MORE
4.	‚Å†HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

10807,10807,gleeaol,1612064518,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö

11286,11286,gkxbiuk,1611762670,"For the bears saying GME will only go to $1000, let me walk you through a little thought exercise. Say your name is Vince. You turned 62 this year. You have five beautiful children, six cars, a dozen properties and three homes. You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation.

‚Ä¢ The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

‚Ä¢ WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Melvin haven't closed out. This is a manipulation tactic to drive down prices, either to cover their losses, or they've made a put at $350. This is the dirtiest trick yet, so they must be desperate. If we smash through $350, they are probably done permanently.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

12962,12962,gk6ebr1,1611353524,"Dear American retards. 

As some of you might know, there is a sub which is basically a german WSB ( r/Mauerstrassenwetten ). 

In this sub, the GME hype is just as real as it is here. 
Everyday at 7:30 CET, we buy whatever we can buy. We Hold, we hold as if our lives were to depend on it, and we try to keep the stock as high as possible, until the reinforcement which has the *actual* buying power, comes in at 15:30 CET, or rather 9:30 EST. 

You are the reinforcement. 

You are the buying power. 

You are the allies, this time with the germans on your side, and a mission to accomplish. 

We count on you to buy and hold, we believe in you to buy and hold, and we depend on you to buy and hold. 

*Together*! We can crush the market manipulating, shorting cunts at melvin, shitron and all the other shitshows. 

This is not just a thing between americans. I have seen people from sweden, the netherlands, spain poland and countless other european nations on this sub, salivating to the thought of crushing GME‚Äòs enemys. 

*I REPEAT SOLDIERS: THIS IS A INTERCONTINENTAL MISSION. EUROPE STANDS STRONG ON YOUR SIDE AND TOGETHER, WE CAN USE OUR üíéü§≤üèª TO CRUSH THE MARKET MANIPULATING CUNTS. 

PREPARE FOR BATTLE! 20 MORE MINUTES!

Melvin, Shitron, and company  will keep this going because it's going to be like 100x more expensive to just give in and they think we will run out of steam or get bored. 

Little do they know is I'm all in.  I eat crayons, stick my finger in electrical sockets, and lick windows.  This is our time.  We buy every dip they throw at us with our 2.3583 shares in our dinky Robinhood accounts.  

They will come hard at us today.  We are fucking with their ability to manipulate the market but we have a vision that they don't.  We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.  It's about creating higher lows each dip.

Edit 4:. 48.50 is our new support.  Get in fellow crayon eaters lol

Edit 5:. You smooth brained üß† idiots are doing it.  Got options sell and buy more shares.  Don't you fucking sell.  52 our new support.  Dont let it dip

Edit 8: 60 is the new support. Hold this line and buy.  Like trench warfare we are advancing and they know they are fucked.  Keep the faith and diamond hands.  Buy more commons.  Sell your options.  You made enough.  We need your help prying away shares from them with people that will hold forever.

The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

I hate to have to repost this however we need to spread AWARENESS on the issue of Market Manipulation and the current events. No, I AM NOT A BOT. I am a real person that lives in a cold dark room with my dog and I haven't showered in 5 weeks. I'm kidding! but I am Canadian. I am also in college so i don't have the fucking time to respond differently to every post. IM SORRY. But you all need to know this information.

GME IS NOT OVER! They are turning the average AUTIST into smooth brains!! This is true that bots have taken over WSB. This is true that bots with many awards bought by the hedge funds have taken over. WE MUST STAND TOGETHER. THIS VIDEO WILL EXPLAIN ALL YOUR DOUBTS!! üíéüôåüíé

In the following weeks, GME has plummeted. I will not deny that this week has been rough for everyone, including myself. The price had the appearance of everyone selling however my belief is that **phantom shares** are being brought into the market which in turn are being sold for less hence driving the price lower. To all the paper hand bitches; they also contributed a bit to the price being driven down. Now, I have linked a video that goes into thorough detail on why this is not over. It's not just showing graphs and discussing the trends, it goes over ALL THE EVENTS that have happened and the EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE '**SQUOOZE** of the **SQUEEZE'**. The HEDGE FUNDS are trying to scare us into selling. THESE BOTS are trying to make us sell. THESE ACCOUNTS(BOTS) can be BOUGHT and to manipulate US! FOR SOME, it is WORKING! Some of these accounts have so many awards blah blah blah, but none of them are OG WSB members!

Also, search up on youtube: **GROW TO ATTAIN**, the latest video on phantom shares will clear up everything for you and what to expect. So far, this is all in our favor if we keep holding or buying shares!

ALSO, look AT THAT LINK I POSTED, IT WILL CLEAR UP MANY THINGS FOR YOU! ALL POSITIVES FOR HOLD GANG, 400 GANG, 300 GANG, 200, 100, 5 GANG.

Also to all the new WSB members, welcome! Some of these posts are TOXIC, though WSB's goal HAS NOT CHANGED; AUTISTS/APES are taking that rocket ship and shoving it into Uranus. This means, if you want in the action, you must decide to get your ticket. Just make sure you don't put your money for College/University (I wonder what happened to that guy/girl) or life savings, this is a very volatile stock. Just know that you either are a paper handed bitch, or a diamond hand BAMF. üíéüôåüíé Once this rocket leaves the lithosphere, we ain't coming back to pick up the stragglers. So GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL HOLDING! APES STAND TOGETHER AND WE SHALL PREVAIL! Also, FEB 9th is coming up, IMPORTANT DAY! Mark it on your calendars! Check out this video for the reason why it's important, plus an explanation on why we have NOT lost the war! THE BATTLE THIS WEEK, WE LOST, HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T WON THE WAR!

Also, rest up, hydrate, and be prepared for the weeks to come. We shall have our movie, with a happy ending!

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you what to do with your money. I'm just an APE who likes this stock!! üíéüôåüíé

I would also post the to the WSB Forum, however, my karma level is too low/they won't allow me to post for some reason, I would post it there too if I could. I can‚Äôt even make a post on this forum either!

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

&#x200B;

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70. Today your hearts and those short selling un-American sons of bitches banking on an American company failing are screaming ""It won't make it back to 100, sell"". And you turn to WSB as this is where it all began for you. You look for help. You look for a sign. Here's your answer.

16128,16128,gkrtpei,1611651360,"To everyone who doesn‚Äôt understand GME and what‚Äôs happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on. 

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so let‚Äôs start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it‚Äôs going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don‚Äôt want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

I‚Äôve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday‚Äôs... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. 


NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow. 

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently. 

Best of luck my fellow retard.",1/26/2021 1:56,GME

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

To the paper hands selling, I strongly suggest you research ""Short Squeeze"" and also research whats happening with GME and similar. Big money buying puts (puts are a loan), they HAVE to buy the stock in the future. That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.

squeezes. The first one is the earthquake, the second one is the fucking tsunami that hits and
wipes out the shorters in fucking biblical fashion.

>There are some analysts who are far better at this than I am and they believe the true
amount of shorts to real available shares is 300%-400%. If that‚Äôs the case then you‚Äôre looking
at brokers closing a short position 3 to 4 times on the same share- meaning some fucking
shorters somewhere are going to have to buy that same stock 3 or 4 times at market price.

>That means 3 or 4 squeezes in succession at higher and higher rates. Let me say this again- there will be more than one squeeze and maybe up to 4.

>I went into this thinking that $420 or even $690 was just meme bullshit. After looking at this I
don‚Äôt know how a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze stays below 4-digits.
Here is some proof of this point ‚Äì it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.
Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let‚Äôs go back again to the available
float 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been
traded 5 times. There‚Äôs just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know
DFV didn‚Äôt sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didn‚Äôt get sold and bought 5
times. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.

>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer
shares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on
gamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to
cover their calls. But there weren‚Äôt enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to
close a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again. (The dips in volume on
the chart were the halts during trading)

Today was less a short squeeze and more a continuation of the Gamma Squeeze we experienced on Friday. Lots of other DD regarding that, but a lot of it has to do with the clearinghouse and share settlements that all happened today.

Look for next week to potentially repeat this as Thursday and Friday, investors will probably pile into $115c 0DTE options and will cause a similar gamma squeeze.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

No financial advice here. Just sharing thoughts.

If you held through today, it was glorious and painful. I saw money I never thought I‚Äôd see and then I lost it all the same.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.

**Long term**

* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B. But that will take time, patience and legit üíéüëê that most don't have.

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",1/25/2021 19:00,GME

18816,18816,gkqnfj0,1611631084,"How much are DIAMOND HANDS worth?

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

The Stock Market as a whole just dropped. PRIMARILY BLUE CHIP LARGE CAP.

This was only a little bit after GME rose to $150. Just enough time for hedge fund managers to get some liquidity.

The Hedge fund managers are going all in but the number of shares to short is pretty much empty. They are getting reserve cash

19076,19076,glbjtm9,1612000501,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it‚Äã",1/30/2021 2:55,GME

And he was good, he paid off his mortgage and the farm with his gains from his trades (barely made by from the income of the farm itself back then). So in the 50s and 60 my grandpa was full on a retarded autists gambling fucking grain futures through old rural snail mail, which allowed him set his family up well and create some generational wealth. 

Fast forward 50 years later my dad and aunt ended up selling the farm for around 2 million. This life runs in my mf blood homie üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1/28/2021 8:23,GME

19655,19655,gl1e8pd,1611830370,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them.

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wii‚Äôs were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This is occurring because some financial institutions got caught with their pants down, trying to push the stock lower by shorting it to an absurdly greedy degree. **The math is important here, because it's forcing an unprecedented short squeeze.** They're now holding onto 250% more shorted stock than available float of the company. This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices. Something like this may never happen again. [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

1) Friday may not be the day. Shorts DO NOT HAVE TO COVER. There is no expiration on those, unless the institution that lent them those shares demands that they cover.

2) Calls that expire Friday do NOT need to be covered by institutions until the next week Mon/Tues (they have 3 days). So even that massive open interest that's ITM may not spur huge movements until next week. Stay patient.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

‚ÄúFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",1/29/2021 4:20,GME

You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation. United under $GME, until the fat cats fall.",1/27/2021 8:51,GME

‚Ä¢ We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

‚Ä¢ The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

‚Ä¢ WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Melvin haven't closed out. This is a manipulation tactic to drive down prices, either to cover their losses, or they've made a put at $350. This is the dirtiest trick yet, so they must be desperate. If we smash through $350, they are probably done permanently.

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

#IN RETARD SPEAK - THESE GUYS ARE TAKING ACTIVE AND DECEITFUL MEASURES TODAY TO GET OUT BEFORE THE BOMB THAT IS GOING TO HIT AT MARKET CLOSE TODAY.  DO NOT BE FUCKING DUPED.

An ELI5 for newbies/those who don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

* The market doesn't care what your entry price is. You may have bought in at 1, or bought in at 156 yesterday. The market doesn't care. Short term we are going to see more erratic behavior. If your conviction entering this trade is that eventually GME will moon and the shorts are getting their nuts squeezed off, WHO CARES what the current stock price is. You know the outcome. Stick to your guns so you can see this thing through. Don't sell then jump back in then sell. Buy in heavy and hold, increase your position during the dips to get lower resistance to the stock. Don't sell, a lot of OTM calls are expiring on Friday. The best is yet to come. 
* Most of us in here are not day traders. You're kidding yourself if you think you can ""time the wave"" just right and sell at the high, then buy back in at the low. Even professional traders don't know what they are doing half the time.
* You only get hurt if you jump off a rollercoaster. In this case, imagine how screwed you will be if you jump off a rocket ship as it's accelerating into space.
* Lastly, don't stay up at night imaging what could have been. Who cares that you didn't notice the story until a few days ago, or that you didn't buy more at this time or sell at that time. You're in for the ride now. No one knows where exactly this will go, but 99.9 percent of us know it's going up considering almost everyone in here is doing yolo life savings amount of money into the stock. Don't be disappointed if you hold for 2 days and aren't getting the gains you expected. The story is in the unfolding stage. If the stock drops back down to 75 today, there is always tomorrow and the next day and the next. The stock no doubt is steadily going up regardless of the crazy intraday prices.
* Imagine your wife's boyfriend stopped right before the climax. Imagine the look on your wife's face when she realized her BF pulled out early. Don't let that be you.

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. **What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share.** And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically **the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up.** This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. **Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you.** Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

21983,21983,gl1ov2q,1611835441,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

You, me, and all of the other beautiful autists are relying on each other to get to the Moon and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard! What we do in this moment will bring on a new era of trading. Our gains will not stop with GME, for the new era where We The People decide value is upon us.

In less than 12 hours, autists from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest financial battle in this history of retail investing.

Retail -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty individual losses anymore.

We will be united in our common interest. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Perhaps its fate that today is the day chicken tenders were invented, and you will once again be fighting for your tendies, not from tyranny, persecution, or annihilation -- but from oppression.

We're fighting for our right to¬†üöÄ, to exist.

And should we win this fight, the 29th of January will no longer be known as another day, but as the day when the autists declared in one voice:

We will not go quietly into expiration!

We will not liquidate without a fight!

We're going to¬†üíé‚úäüèΩ!

We're going to¬†üöÄ!

Today we celebrate Tendy Day.

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop",1/27/2021 4:05,GME

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no.

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

23690,23690,gk6ebr1,1611353524,"Dear American retards. 

As some of you might know, there is a sub which is basically a german WSB ( r/Mauerstrassenwetten ). 

In this sub, the GME hype is just as real as it is here. 
Everyday at 7:30 CET, we buy whatever we can buy. We Hold, we hold as if our lives were to depend on it, and we try to keep the stock as high as possible, until the reinforcement which has the *actual* buying power, comes in at 15:30 CET, or rather 9:30 EST. 

You are the reinforcement. 

You are the buying power. 

You are the allies, this time with the germans on your side, and a mission to accomplish. 

We count on you to buy and hold, we believe in you to buy and hold, and we depend on you to buy and hold. 

*Together*! We can crush the market manipulating, shorting cunts at melvin, shitron and all the other shitshows. 

This is not just a thing between americans. I have seen people from sweden, the netherlands, spain poland and countless other european nations on this sub, salivating to the thought of crushing GME‚Äòs enemys. 

*I REPEAT SOLDIERS: THIS IS A INTERCONTINENTAL MISSION. EUROPE STANDS STRONG ON YOUR SIDE AND TOGETHER, WE CAN USE OUR üíéü§≤üèª TO CRUSH THE MARKET MANIPULATING CUNTS. 

PREPARE FOR BATTLE! 20 MORE MINUTES!

Melvin, Shitron, and company  will keep this going because it's going to be like 100x more expensive to just give in and they think we will run out of steam or get bored. 

Little do they know is I'm all in.  I eat crayons, stick my finger in electrical sockets, and lick windows.  This is our time.  We buy every dip they throw at us with our 2.3583 shares in our dinky Robinhood accounts.  

They will come hard at us today.  We are fucking with their ability to manipulate the market but we have a vision that they don't.  We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.  It's about creating higher lows each dip.

Edit 3: Dont you sell.....I know you.....you are thinking about it.  You are up 100%.  This never happens to you.  This is life changing money......no you sit on your dumb hands.  Ask your wife's boyfriend to hold you down like he does to her.  You fucking sit and wait.....it's not over yet

Edit 4:. 48.50 is our new support.  Get in fellow crayon eaters lol

Edit 5:. You smooth brained üß† idiots are doing it.  Got options sell and buy more shares.  Don't you fucking sell.  52 our new support.  Dont let it dip

Edit 6: Someone actually asked me about it being over bought on the RSI.  Dude.  It's to the moon. This thing should be a 90s on the 1 hour RSI.

Edit 7:. Updates.  So we hit big sell wall around 75.  They are fucking scared and they pushed it down and shut down the breakers.  Good.  Now don't get scared.  Don't paper hands.  Now we buy the dip and they will say fuckkmmmeeee.  

Edit 8: 60 is the new support. Hold this line and buy.  Like trench warfare we are advancing and they know they are fucked.  Keep the faith and diamond hands.  Buy more commons.  Sell your options.  You made enough.  We need your help prying away shares from them with people that will hold forever.

23778,23778,gk84kra,1611372183,"That was a margin call
The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",1/29/2021 4:20,GME

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow.

3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. ‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. ‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. ‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. ‚Å†What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)
5. ‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)
6. ‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. ‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. ‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

25762,25762,gloavom,1612256545,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.

27948,27948,glbjia9,1612000347,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢  ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢  ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",1/29/2021 16:44,GME

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!",1/29/2021 16:55,GME

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

29897,29897,gldjm2t,1612050280,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest",1/30/2021 14:46,GME

30180,30180,gl20jv3,1611842040,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

1. ‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

31922,31922,gloavom,1612256545,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what‚Äôs SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï)

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",2/2/2021 14:46,GME

1 of 2 things will happen now. 

1. Like you said, Bears finally start cutting their losses before further bleeding, or...

2. You have magical inverse factors, and GME collapses right as you close your put positions, taking all of us with you. You believe up, it goes down. You believe down, it goes up.

33236,33236,gki2vcv,1611498041,"I was actually more in agreement with the conclusions in your previous posts than this one. My theory: This is showing more hallmarks of Blue Apron squeeze than a short squeeze.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.

**Long term**

* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B. But that will take time, patience and legit üíéüëê that most don't have.

* The market doesn't care what your entry price is. You may have bought in at 1, or bought in at 156 yesterday. The market doesn't care. Short term we are going to see more erratic behavior. If your conviction entering this trade is that eventually GME will moon and the shorts are getting their nuts squeezed off, WHO CARES what the current stock price is. You know the outcome. Stick to your guns so you can see this thing through. Don't sell then jump back in then sell. Buy in heavy and hold, increase your position during the dips to get lower resistance to the stock. Don't sell, a lot of OTM calls are expiring on Friday. The best is yet to come. 
* Most of us in here are not day traders. You're kidding yourself if you think you can ""time the wave"" just right and sell at the high, then buy back in at the low. Even professional traders don't know what they are doing half the time.
* You only get hurt if you jump off a rollercoaster. In this case, imagine how screwed you will be if you jump off a rocket ship as it's accelerating into space.
* Lastly, don't stay up at night imaging what could have been. Who cares that you didn't notice the story until a few days ago, or that you didn't buy more at this time or sell at that time. You're in for the ride now. No one knows where exactly this will go, but 99.9 percent of us know it's going up considering almost everyone in here is doing yolo life savings amount of money into the stock. Don't be disappointed if you hold for 2 days and aren't getting the gains you expected. The story is in the unfolding stage. If the stock drops back down to 75 today, there is always tomorrow and the next day and the next. The stock no doubt is steadily going up regardless of the crazy intraday prices.
* Imagine your wife's boyfriend stopped right before the climax. Imagine the look on your wife's face when she realized her BF pulled out early. Don't let that be you. 
* BECOME THE WIFE'S BOYFRIEND. BUY GME. POUND THE SHORTS INTO GRAINY DUST",1/26/2021 21:24,GME

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. **What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share.** And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically **the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up.** This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. **Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you.** Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.

Select GME > Trade > Sell > Dollars Tab top right > Limit Order > Set to $1000, Continue > Extended Hours > Good till cancelled > Pick number of shares > Send it

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

**TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.**

I'll be buying shares of GME  today out of pure principle. These fucks on Wall Street tanked the economy in 2008. I lost my job and was unemployed for almost 2 years.  We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no. If all I need to do is buy gme to stick it to these fucks then so be it. Buying 500 shares today.",1/26/2021 13:08,GME

35085,35085,gktmyz0,1611698081,"THINGS U CAN DO TO HELP THE SQUEEZE

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

May we print tendies and may the power of WSBüíéüëêüèΩ empower us all to not üìÉüëêüèΩ.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	‚Å†Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	‚Å†Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	‚Å†Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	‚Å†Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	‚Å†What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	‚Å†Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	‚Å†Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	‚Å†Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	‚Å†Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

Please forgive me about the confusion yesterday. My last comment got deleted without an explanation. I did not delete my comments. This caused a lot of panic for those following along. Mods, if there is anything I am doing wrong, please let me know so I can correct and prevent another take down.

For Corporate America, I offer you this DD.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but üçåüçåüçå for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.

Edit:  Woah.  My first gold!  Thank you, ape.  I have no idea what to do with gold, but I appreciate it.  Wish I could put it towards GME.

Edit 2:  wtf is happening?  Another gold?  Thank you!  I wrote this after watching that smug bastard on CNBC try to claim we were doing something illegal.  It pissed me off, so I had to say something.

Those of us who are investors in GME aren't making comments like,  "" Look how much it dropped its so unfair""

 **The real investors,**  remember the previous GME squeeze and we know what happened was a desperate attempt by shorts to flood the market with short shares to drop the price.  This is actually, a good sign.  We have all seen this before. On January 27th.  

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",2/2/2021 14:46,GME

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

37055,37055,gl2x412,1611866833,"**GME has made me want to quit my job. And not because of tendies**   


But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy f\*ks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a f\*king WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even an r-word. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i‚Äôm sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the meantime honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‚Äòlooking out‚Äô for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don‚Äôt believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

# Friday, Jan 29 is NOT the sell date for GME.

Recently I have started to see a lot of posts and comments hinting at a Friday sell-off because that is when the squeeze is going to happen. **THIS IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!**

The reason why Friday was initially brought up, to begin with, is because every OTM GME call that was written by MMs a couple of weeks ago are now ITM. This means by Friday close, any MM that did not properly hedge their GME position will be a victim to a Gamma squeeze in which millions of GME shares will have to be bought in order to fill out the call orders as they get exercised. This will **potentially** trigger the short squeeze as millions of shares are bought in quick succession forcing the price upwards in an even more parabolic manner.

If the short squeeze does not happen on Friday, then next week will just be a repeat of this week. More retail buying, more CNBC fear-mongering, and more GME calls becoming ITM.

# Fundamentally, there is NO difference between this Friday and any other Friday

Also, on another note, when the short squeeze does happen, keep these facts in mind:

# Short Squeezes are NOT quick events. Shorters can take days or even WEEKS to cover their positions.

I have also noticed that some people are starting to get the idea that the squeeze will be quick and be done.  **THIS IS FALSE.**

The duration of a short squeeze is measured by the Days To Cover Ratio **(Total Short Float / Average Daily Trading Volume).**

Right now, the DTC is at 6 days on MarketBeat and the short float is at 121% as of this morning [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

DTC data at shortsqueeze is more recent. It has DTC at 2.5days. 

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME)

Find short float data here:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Feel free to send me more links so I can post it here and make adjustments.

**When can you tell a short squeeze is happening?**

Pay very close attention to the short float as per the total number of shares outstanding. When the short float starts to go down drastically, it means the rocket ship just hit 0 Gs and we are now bound for infinity and beyond!

**What is the price target?**

No one knows but unlike the squeeze of Volkswagon, where the institutions reached an agreement with the company board, there is **NO WAY** hedge funds can make an agreement with us retail investors (*because we are not a singular entity and anyone that says otherwise is either ignorant or pushing a false narrative*) so the price is whatever we want it to be. Either way, that $1,000 price target is starting to look **REALLY** cheap right now so in my opinion, you might want to add a zero to that.

Happy hunting.",1/28/2021 14:42,GME
37278,37278,gl34xbk,1611870448,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

AND STOP THINKING THE SQUEEZE WILL NE FRODAY. THERES NO SET TIME FOR IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS WE HAVE CONTROL FOR HOW FAR IT GOES. 

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

I hate to have to repost this however we need to spread AWARENESS on the issue of Market Manipulation and the current events. No, I AM NOT A BOT. I am a real person that lives in a cold dark room with my dog and I haven't showered in 5 weeks. I'm kidding! but I am Canadian. I am also in college so i don't have the fucking time to respond differently to every post. IM SORRY. But you all need to know this information.

GME IS NOT OVER! They are turning the average AUTIST into smooth brains!! This is true that bots have taken over WSB. This is true that bots with many awards bought by the hedge funds have taken over. WE MUST STAND TOGETHER. THIS VIDEO WILL EXPLAIN ALL YOUR DOUBTS!! üíéüôåüíé

In the following weeks, GME has plummeted. I will not deny that this week has been rough for everyone, including myself. The price had the appearance of everyone selling however my belief is that **phantom shares** are being brought into the market which in turn are being sold for less hence driving the price lower. To all the paper hand bitches; they also contributed a bit to the price being driven down. Now, I have linked a video that goes into thorough detail on why this is not over. It's not just showing graphs and discussing the trends, it goes over ALL THE EVENTS that have happened and the EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE '**SQUOOZE** of the **SQUEEZE'**. The HEDGE FUNDS are trying to scare us into selling. THESE BOTS are trying to make us sell. THESE ACCOUNTS(BOTS) can be BOUGHT and to manipulate US! FOR SOME, it is WORKING! Some of these accounts have so many awards blah blah blah, but none of them are OG WSB members!

Also, search up on youtube: **GROW TO ATTAIN**, the latest video on phantom shares will clear up everything for you and what to expect. So far, this is all in our favor if we keep holding or buying shares!

ALSO, look AT THAT LINK I POSTED, IT WILL CLEAR UP MANY THINGS FOR YOU! ALL POSITIVES FOR HOLD GANG, 400 GANG, 300 GANG, 200, 100, 5 GANG.

Also to all the new WSB members, welcome! Some of these posts are TOXIC, though WSB's goal HAS NOT CHANGED; AUTISTS/APES are taking that rocket ship and shoving it into Uranus. This means, if you want in the action, you must decide to get your ticket. Just make sure you don't put your money for College/University (I wonder what happened to that guy/girl) or life savings, this is a very volatile stock. Just know that you either are a paper handed bitch, or a diamond hand BAMF. üíéüôåüíé Once this rocket leaves the lithosphere, we ain't coming back to pick up the stragglers. So GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL HOLDING! APES STAND TOGETHER AND WE SHALL PREVAIL! Also, FEB 9th is coming up, IMPORTANT DAY! Mark it on your calendars! Check out this video for the reason why it's important, plus an explanation on why we have NOT lost the war! THE BATTLE THIS WEEK, WE LOST, HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T WON THE WAR!

Also, rest up, hydrate, and be prepared for the weeks to come. We shall have our movie, with a happy ending!

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you what to do with your money. I'm just an APE who likes this stock!! üíéüôåüíé

I would also post the to the WSB Forum, however, my karma level is too low/they won't allow me to post for some reason, I would post it there too if I could. I can‚Äôt even make a post on this forum either!

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

\-They didn't believe him, so with steel balls a'swinging he doubled down and bought 50K more shares of GME

\-Yesterday Gamestop CFO resigned, which is excellent news because he's part of the old guard that almost let Gamestop fade into non-existence. New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

Now here i am, only up $1800, with my dick in my hand, waiting for another catalyst so we can hopefully squeeze again. What they did to all of us, ALL OF US, is nothing short of fucking robbery. All to protect dumb fucking billionaires that didn‚Äôt know how manage risk. Fuck those hedge funds, fuck robinhood, fuck the SEC, fuck everyone that has been involved in this fucking fraudulent market. I hope we all get our tendies, because they did nothing short of opening up your wallet and taking out all your money. Actually even worse than that. 

good luck to all you apes. i hope we get some payback for these cocksuckers betting against us. also rip my $25,000.",2/24/2021 19:20,GME

They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of üíéüñê who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. üíéüñê need to understand this and help all the üßªüñê retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",2/24/2021 15:34,GME

**THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SQUEEZE YET, PATIENCE AND DIAMOND HANDS REQUIRED**

The price shot up massively yesterday, true. But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.

But I think its essential to remember this

**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**

In a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.

**This is NOT what is happening now.**
The price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down 

**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**

UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.

**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**

Dont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.

I devolved from ape form in order to be human and lose more money from these said stocks, when I could've just held on with my once diamond hands and added more funds to my account, instead of selling on a 60%/$1000 loss (not so much to the average person, but to a college student, quite a lot no?)

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.  But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.

&#x200B;

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn‚Äôt just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO üíé ü§≤ AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD

41538,41538,gl20jv3,1611842040,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but üçåüçåüçå for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.

Edit:  Woah.  My first gold!  Thank you, ape.  I have no idea what to do with gold, but I appreciate it.  Wish I could put it towards GME.

Edit 2:  wtf is happening?  Another gold?  Thank you!  I wrote this after watching that smug bastard on CNBC try to claim we were doing something illegal.  It pissed me off, so I had to say something.

Those of us who are investors in GME aren't making comments like,  "" Look how much it dropped its so unfair""

 **The real investors,**  remember the previous GME squeeze and we know what happened was a desperate attempt by shorts to flood the market with short shares to drop the price.  This is actually, a good sign.  We have all seen this before. On January 27th.  

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you.

I am green AF. I opened an investing account a week before the first GME squeeze so I could buy some shares in psilocybin. GME was all over the media, I bought into the hype with 1 share. I realized what a dumb ape move that was, so when it dipped hard, I bought 1 more.

TODAY, for the first time since I opened my account, I'm at a profit. Of $100. On GME. I made an extra $100 on the money I initially invested.

To bigger apes, this is nothing. It's pocket change. But to me, it's a revelation. It's a sign that, if I play my cards right, I *might* be able to afford a house in about 10 years. I might be able to afford to have my parents stay in a guest house on my property and hire a PSW when they need that help, instead of subjecting them to LTC homes.

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

45235,45235,gl2x412,1611866833,"**GME has made me want to quit my job. And not because of tendies**   


But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy f\*ks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a f\*king WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even an r-word. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i‚Äôm sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the meantime honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‚Äòlooking out‚Äô for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don‚Äôt believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

# Friday, Jan 29 is NOT the sell date for GME.

Recently I have started to see a lot of posts and comments hinting at a Friday sell-off because that is when the squeeze is going to happen. **THIS IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!**

The reason why Friday was initially brought up, to begin with, is because every OTM GME call that was written by MMs a couple of weeks ago are now ITM. This means by Friday close, any MM that did not properly hedge their GME position will be a victim to a Gamma squeeze in which millions of GME shares will have to be bought in order to fill out the call orders as they get exercised. This will **potentially** trigger the short squeeze as millions of shares are bought in quick succession forcing the price upwards in an even more parabolic manner.

If the short squeeze does not happen on Friday, then next week will just be a repeat of this week. More retail buying, more CNBC fear-mongering, and more GME calls becoming ITM.

# Fundamentally, there is NO difference between this Friday and any other Friday

Also, on another note, when the short squeeze does happen, keep these facts in mind:

# Short Squeezes are NOT quick events. Shorters can take days or even WEEKS to cover their positions.

I have also noticed that some people are starting to get the idea that the squeeze will be quick and be done.  **THIS IS FALSE.**

The duration of a short squeeze is measured by the Days To Cover Ratio **(Total Short Float / Average Daily Trading Volume).**

Right now, the DTC is at 6 days on MarketBeat and the short float is at 121% as of this morning [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

DTC data at shortsqueeze is more recent. It has DTC at 2.5days. 

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME)

Find short float data here:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Feel free to send me more links so I can post it here and make adjustments.

**When can you tell a short squeeze is happening?**

Pay very close attention to the short float as per the total number of shares outstanding. When the short float starts to go down drastically, it means the rocket ship just hit 0 Gs and we are now bound for infinity and beyond!

**What is the price target?**

No one knows but unlike the squeeze of Volkswagon, where the institutions reached an agreement with the company board, there is **NO WAY** hedge funds can make an agreement with us retail investors (*because we are not a singular entity and anyone that says otherwise is either ignorant or pushing a false narrative*) so the price is whatever we want it to be. Either way, that $1,000 price target is starting to look **REALLY** cheap right now so in my opinion, you might want to add a zero to that.

Happy hunting.",1/28/2021 14:42,GME
45458,45458,gl34xbk,1611870448,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

AND STOP THINKING THE SQUEEZE WILL NE FRODAY. THERES NO SET TIME FOR IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS WE HAVE CONTROL FOR HOW FAR IT GOES. 

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

45645,45645,gleeaol,1612064518,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö
